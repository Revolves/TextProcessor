This is an important research result because it shows the value of the space station as an Earth remote sensing platform. In this case, the space station hosts an instrument called the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean ().This imager gets data on the wavelengths of light that it measures reflecting back from the surface of the Earth. It is particularly tuned to get hundreds of bands, much more than the eight different bands you would usually get from a remote sensing instrument like . These hundreds of different bands can be teased apart for details and information that you can’t get from normal remote sensing data.For example, using HICO you can distinguish between sediment and chlorophyll in the water column. Chlorophyll, which is a sign of algae, is an indicator that nitrogen is flowing in—say from fertilizers on the land. That is an important marker of water quality issues. In a sediment-laden bay, however, it can be really difficult to differentiate between the two—often called the “brown water” problem by ocean remote sensing experts.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  to develop a proof-of-concept to help monitor and protect our water supplies as required by the nation’s Clean Water Act. The work was originally funded by the EPA under a . The results were honored with a  at the 2013 International Space Station Research and Development Conference. Darryl Keith, Ph.D., accepted the award on behalf of his research team regarding their work using HICO to gather imagery for ocean protection for the EPA.EPA researchers went out and timed collections of their field observations with an over-flight of the space station. The scientists were able to put the data together to get better measurements for dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll A. This allowed them to develop models that suggest the presence of algal blooms, which present a danger to the health of sea life.With the HICO proof-of-concept in hand, EPA researchers now are interested in using these models to develop an app that anyone can use to obtain real-time water quality information. The goal is to have algorithms that don’t require coordinating the space station or satellites with field data. The success of such a venture would mean real-time updates without anyone having to go into the field. This kind of an application developed by another government agency is really important for showing the broad value of the space station.HICO has been converted into a space station facility, with open access for both users funded by NASA’s Earth Science Division, and also commercial users sponsored by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space () to use space station as a National Laboratory. Both organizations have announced opportunities to . This is just the first of a number of remote sensing instruments headed for the space station that will transform the way this orbiting laboratory serves our need for data about the Earth below.Julie A. Robinson, Ph.D. International Space Station Program ScientistAs astronauts continue to move away from Earth, our ties back to our planet are going to be strained. We won’t have the capability to jump into a return capsule and be back to Earth in 90 minutes.To move further away from Earth, we have to continue to develop more autonomous systems in our spacecraft that supply our fundamental needs for oxygen production and carbon dioxide (CO) removal, clean water and food. The genetic coding in plants to perform these functions has been refined and improved for the past 3-4 billion years as plants have continually evolved on Earth. So the code is pretty good. As long as we can provide biological organisms like plants or algae with the nutrients and support systems they need, they will pretty much know what to do. What they will do is clean water, change CO into oxygen and generate food. From a life support system, that’s kind of what you want to happen.There are some interesting things about plants that we’ll have to deal with in space. For instance, we don’t have bumblebees in orbit, so who does the pollination? Who goes from flower to flower? We’ve actually had astronauts using cotton swabs to move pollen from one flower to another, in particular when we were growing  a few years back. As we get more and more into it, we need to figure out how to do this without using the crew, since it would not be efficient to have them pollinating a field with cotton swabs.View of willow trees in an Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) incubator for the Advanced Plant Experiments on Orbit – Cambium () experiment aboard the International Space Station during Expedition 21. (NASA)We have quite a number of things going on and coming to fruition on the . We currently have a small habitat called the Advanced Biological Research System () in orbit performing fundamental studies of plant growth in the microgravity environment. It has two independent chambers that are tightly controlled and have LED lights. We can manage moisture delivery, CO and trace gases inside those chambers and do some real hard science investigations. The Russian segment has a habitat, too, called the .The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is a similar chamber under development, but that one will be larger. The APH will enable us to use larger plants and different species, all of which will be tightly controlled during growth investigations.Another really exciting new system launching to the space station probably around the middle of next year is the Vegetable Production System (). It will begin bridging the gap between a pure science facility and a food production system. We are in the ground testing phase of the flight unit to assure it is safe for operation aboard the station with the help of the facility’s builder, Orbital Technologies Corporation of Madison, Wis. Orbitec. They also will manufacture the APH.The beauty of the Veggie unit is that it’s really just a light canopy with a fan and a watering mat for growing plants, using the cabin atmosphere aboard the space station. The crew will have an opportunity to farm about two and a half square feet, which is a pretty good sized growing area. This system also has great potential as a platform for educational programs at the high school level, where students could grow the same plants in similar systems in their classrooms. The Veggie greenhouse will fit into an  on the International Space Station for use with plant investigations in orbit. (NASA)We’re going to start growing lettuce plants in Veggie next year as a test run, because lettuce is well suited for this initial testing. Lettuce is a good first crop selection because it is a rapid growing plant, with a high edible content, and generally has a small micro flora content.  We will be using specially designed seed pillows to contain the below ground portion of the lettuce plant containing the roots, rooting media, and moisture delivery system. The plants will sprout and grow up through those pillows. Ultimately scientists will be able to grow larger plants like dwarf tomatoes or peppers.We are continuing to do the testing associated with making sure the food grown in the closed environment of the space station is safe to eat for the crew. We hope that within a short period we will be able to augment the astronauts’ diets with herbs and spices and maybe onions, peppers or tomatoes, something to give the crunch factor. Ultimately, we hope to move to even larger chambers to begin producing more of the staple crops, such as potatoes or beans.All of these new plant systems should be up and running in the very near future. Veggie should be aboard station next year, and by the middle of 2015 we expect to deploy the APH, completing the suite of plant facilities in orbit.When talking about life-support systems for spaceflight, there’s obviously a more complicated viewpoint that says the systems that connect all that together are pretty elaborate and cumbersome. There are reservoirs, hoppers and a vast array of other things that have to be in place to operate a bioregenerative system, which makes them big and, in some cases, energy intensive. On short-duration missions we would probably do better packing a picnic lunch and taking only the support systems we need. The further we are away from Earth, and the longer it takes us to get back, however, drives systems planning in the regenerative direction. What we’re doing is laying the groundwork that will enable those kinds of decisions to be made for long-duration exploration. NASA astronaut Mike Fossum, Expedition 28 flight engineer, inspects a new growth experiment on the BIO-5 -2 (Plants-2) payload with its Lada-01 greenhouse in the Zvezda service module of the International Space Station. (NASA)There’s a more near-term thing that we’re also looking at, which is the therapeutic aspects of growing plants. People have been exercising their “green thumbs” for this reason for years. They plant their little gardens, and the aromas of plants have a very positive impact on the way these people feel about things. The psychological effects of keeping plants are still somewhat unknown, and we’re hoping to get better insight into that. These effects include the nurturing aspects of watching something grow and caring for it. During spaceflight, far from Earth or on a long-duration mission, a totally sterile environment may not be what is desired. While you can’t have a pet dog or cat to make your living space a little more homey, perhaps you could have a  to care for, as it provides oxygen and sustenance. "

        "content": "       Under consideration to become the next Discovery Program mission, VERITAS would reveal the inner workings of Earth''s mysterious \"twin.\"     Imagine Earth. Now fill the skies with thick, Sun-obscuring clouds of sulfuric acid; boil off the oceans by cranking up the temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit (nearly 500 degrees Celsius), and boost the air pressure high enough to flatten you like a pancake. What you now have is Venus, a rocky planet similar in size to Earth but different in almost every other way.How these \"sister planets\" evolved so differently has been a burning scientific question for decades, and a proposed mission called VERITAS seeks to provide answers by transforming our understanding of the internal geodynamics that shaped the planet. The mission could lend insights into our own planet''s evolution and even help us better understand rocky planets orbiting  stars.Short for Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography & Spectroscopy, VERITAS is  for selection under  and would be managed by NASA''s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. The project''s partners include Lockheed Martin, the Italian Space Agency, the German Space Agency, and the French Space Agency.\"Venus is like this cosmic gift of an accident,\" said Suzanne Smrekar, principal investigator of VERITAS at JPL. \"You have these two planetary bodies - Earth and Venus - that started out nearly the same but have gone down two completely different evolutionary paths, but we don''t know why.\"This interactive model compares the sizes of Venus (left) and Earth. To discover more about the similarities and differences of the two planets, zoom in and give them a spin, or use the search function at bottom for more. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech. View the full interactive experience at . Credit: NASA/JPL-CaltechThe last mission to study the planet''s surface, NASA''s Magellan spacecraft, ended in 1994. While it provided tantalizing clues about Venus'' geology, the instrumentation couldn''t provide certitude as to the origin of many of the planet''s surface features.Proposed for a 2026 launch, VERITAS would orbit the planet and peer through the obscuring clouds with a powerful state-of-the art radar system to create 3D global maps and a near-infrared spectrometer to figure out what the surface is made of. It would also measure the planet''s gravitational field to determine the structure of Venus'' interior. Together, the instruments would offer clues about the planet''s past and present geologic processes, from its core to its surface.Here on Earth, the rigid crust that envelops the planet is broken into a jigsaw puzzle of tectonic plates atop the mantle. Convection in the mantle helps drive motion of the surface plates. As some plates descend into the interior - a process known as subduction - they melt, and volcanic outgassing releases volatiles (such as water, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane) into the atmosphere.Learning more about the geologic processes on Venus - where the warm crust is a good analogy for early Earth''s, when the plates were just beginning to form - could offer a valuable glimpse into how these processes began on Earth.\"The biggest mystery to me is the extent of deformation structures on Venus\" - areas of rock on the surface that have buckled under immense geologic pressure - \"that could be studied to understand the nature of tectonic activity on the planet,\" said science team member Joann Stock, a professor of geology and geophysics at Caltech''s Seismological Laboratory in Pasadena.Producing high-resolution 3D topographic maps VERITAS would bring into focus structures that have previously been too small to resolve, added Stock. These structures could include raised topography on both sides of strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault, which is an indicator of major tectonic activity. VERITAS would also look for active surface faulting using something called interferometric deformation maps for the first time beyond Earth.In addition, VERITAS would study vast deformation structures called tessera. These plateau-like features may be analogous to Earth''s continents. A leading theory is that Earth''s continents formed when iron-rich oceanic crust subducted and melted in the presence of water, producing huge volumes of new, less iron-rich continental crust that rose above the ocean.To determine if Venus'' tessera plateaus formed in a similar way to Earth''s continents, VERITAS would construct the first global multispectral maps of Venus'' surface composition. If their composition resembles that of continental crust, we''d also gain information about Venus'' wetter past.On Earth, plate tectonics and volcanism go hand in hand. But what about on Venus?\"Determining whether Venus is actively undergoing volcanic activity and understanding what process is driving it is one of the really exciting questions I''d love to see answered,\" said planetary scientist Jennifer Whitten, a VERITAS science team member at Tulane University in New Orleans.Using its spectrometer, VERITAS would determine which rocks recently formed from erupting magma, before interactions with the atmosphere have had time to change their chemical composition. In addition, the spectrometer would search for hotspots from active eruptions, while the radar instrument would search for active faulting, an indication of tectonic activity.In getting to know Venus'' volcanoes and the geophysical processes causing them, scientists could also gauge their impact on the planet''s climate and, perhaps, answer another key question: Does the planet''s interior still contain large quantities of water like Earth''s does?Plate tectonics and volcanism don''t just affect how a planet takes shape; they are intimately tied to a planet''s habitability. Plate tectonics strongly affects Earth''s long-term climate by influencing the processes that keep the atmosphere in balance: volcanism, which release volatiles into the atmosphere, and subduction, which recycles volatiles back into the interior. Also, the formation and erosion of Earth''s continents have a major influence on the composition of the oceans and atmosphere. Together, these processes provide the nutrients and a habitable climate for life to thrive.But what is the delicate geodynamic balance that ultimately makes a planet habitable? Considering the discovery of thousands of exoplanets orbiting stars other than our Sun, the answer could inform our understanding of their nature.\"To unwrap the mysteries of Venus we have to look under the hood at Venus'' interior; it is the engine for global geologic and atmospheric evolution,\" said Smrekar. \"Are Venus and Earth fundamentally unique worlds? Or are the differences between these ''twins'' only cosmetic? Answering this question is key to understanding what makes other rocky planets habitable and, ultimately, emerge with life.\"Read more about Discovery Mission proposals selected to develop concept studies .Ian J.

        "content": "Viewed from space, one of the most striking features of our home planet is the water, in both liquid and frozen forms, that covers approximately 75% of the Earth’s surface. Geologic evidence suggests that large amounts of water have likely flowed on Earth for the past 3.8 billion years—most of its existence. Believed to have initially arrived on the surface through the emissions of ancient volcanoes, water is a vital substance that sets the Earth apart from the rest of the planets in our solar system. In particular, water appears to be a necessary ingredient for the development and nourishment of life.Earth is a water planet: three-quarters of the surface is covered by water, and water-rich clouds fill the sky. (NASA.)Water is practically everywhere on Earth. Moreover, it is the only known substance that can naturally exist as a gas, a liquid, and solid within the relatively small range of air temperatures and pressures found at the Earth’s surface.Water is the only common substance that can exist naturally as a gas, liquid, or solid at the relatively small range of temperatures and pressures found on the Earth’s surface. Sometimes, all three states are even present in the same time and place, such as this wintertime eruption of a geyser in Yellowstone National Park.  (Photograph ©2008 )In all, the Earth’s water content is about 1.39 billion cubic kilometers (331 million cubic miles), with the bulk of it, about 96.5%, being in the global oceans. As for the rest, approximately 1.7% is stored in the polar icecaps, glaciers, and permanent snow, and another 1.7% is stored in groundwater, lakes, rivers, streams, and soil. Only a thousandth of 1% of the water on Earth exists as water vapor in the atmosphere.Despite its small amount, this water vapor has a huge influence on the planet. Water vapor is a powerful  greenhouse gas, and it is a major driver of  the Earth’s weather and climate as it travels around the globe, transporting  with it. Latent heat is heat obtained by water molecules as they transition from liquid or solid to vapor; the heat is released when the molecules condense from vapor back to liquid or solid form, creating cloud droplets and various forms of precipitation.Water vapor—and with it energy—is carried around the globe by weather systems. This satellite image shows the distribution of water vapor over Africa and the Atlantic Ocean. White areas have high concentrations of water vapor, while dark regions are relatively dry. The brightest white areas are towering thunderclouds. The image was acquired on the morning of September 2, 2010 by SEVIRI aboard   METEOSAT-9. [Watch this  (23 MB QuickTime) of similar data to see the movement of water vapor over time.] (Image ©2010 )For human needs, the amount of freshwater on Earth—for drinking and agriculture—is particularly important. Freshwater exists in lakes, rivers, groundwater, and frozen as snow and ice. Estimates of groundwater are particularly difficult to make, and they vary widely. (The value in the above table is near the high end of the range.)Groundwater may constitute anywhere from approximately 22 to 30% of fresh water, with ice (including ice caps, glaciers, permanent snow, ground ice, and permafrost) accounting for  most of the remaining 78 to 70%.The water, or hydrologic, cycle describes the pilgrimage of water as water molecules make their way from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere and back again, in some cases to below the surface. This gigantic system, powered by energy from the Sun, is a continuous exchange of moisture between the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land.Earth’s water continuously moves through the atmosphere, into and out of the oceans, over the land surface, and underground.  ( courtesy NOAA National Weather Service )Studies have revealed that evaporation—the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas—from oceans, seas, and other bodies of water (lakes, rivers, streams) provides nearly 90% of the moisture in our atmosphere. Most of the remaining 10% found in the atmosphere is released by plants through transpiration. Plants take in water through their roots, then release it through small pores on the underside of their leaves. In addition, a very small portion of water vapor enters the atmosphere through sublimation, the process by which water changes directly from a solid (ice or snow) to a gas. The gradual shrinking of snow banks in cases when the temperature remains below freezing results from sublimation.Together, evaporation, transpiration, and sublimation, plus volcanic emissions, account for almost all the water vapor in the atmosphere that isn’t inserted through human activities. While evaporation from the oceans is the primary vehicle for driving the surface-to-atmosphere portion of the hydrologic cycle, transpiration is also significant. For example, a cornfield 1 acre in size can transpire as much as 4,000 gallons of water every day.After the water enters the lower atmosphere, rising air currents carry it upward, often high into the atmosphere, where the air is cooler. In the cool air, water vapor is more likely to condense from a gas to a liquid to form cloud droplets. Cloud droplets can grow and produce precipitation (including rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, and hail), which is the primary mechanism for transporting water from the atmosphere back to the Earth’s surface.When precipitation falls over the land surface, it follows various routes in its subsequent paths. Some of it evaporates, returning to the atmosphere; some seeps into the ground as soil moisture or groundwater; and some runs off into rivers and streams. Almost all of the water eventually flows into the oceans or other bodies of water, where the cycle continues. At different stages of the cycle, some of the water is intercepted by humans or other life forms for drinking, washing, irrigating, and a large variety of other uses.Groundwater is found in two broadly defined layers of the soil, the “zone of aeration,” where gaps in the soil are filled with both air and water, and, further down, the “zone of saturation,” where the gaps are completely filled with water. The boundary between these two zones is known as the  which rises or falls as the amount of groundwater changes.The amount of water in the atmosphere at any moment in time is only 12,900 cubic kilometers, a minute fraction of Earth’s total water supply: if it were to completely rain out, atmospheric moisture would cover the Earth’s surface to a depth of only 2.5 centimeters. However, far more water—in fact, some 495,000 cubic kilometers of it—are cycled through the atmosphere every year. It is as if the entire amount of water in the air were removed and replenished nearly 40 times a year.This map shows the distribution of water vapor throughout the depth of the atmosphere during August 2010. Even the wettest regions would form a layer of water only 60 millimeters deep if it were condensed at the surface. (NASA image by Robert Simmon, using  & AMSU data.)Water continually evaporates, condenses, and precipitates, and on a global basis, evaporation approximately equals precipitation. Because of this equality, the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere remains approximately the same over time. However, over the continents, precipitation routinely exceeds evaporation, and conversely, over the oceans, evaporation exceeds precipitation.In the case of the oceans, the continual excess of evaporation versus precipitation would eventually leave the oceans empty if they were not being replenished by additional means. Not only are they being replenished, largely through runoff from the land areas, but over the past 100 years, they have been replenished: sea level around the globe has risen approximately 17 centimeters over the course of the twentieth century.Sea level has been rising over the past century, partly due to thermal expansion of the ocean as it warms, and partly due to the melting of glaciers and ice caps. (Graph ©2010 )Sea level has risen both because of warming of the oceans, causing water to expand and increase in volume, and because more water has been entering the ocean than the amount leaving it through evaporation or other means. A primary cause for increased mass of water entering the ocean is the calving or melting of land ice (ice sheets and glaciers). Sea ice is already in the ocean, so increases or decreases in the annual amount of sea ice do not significantly affect sea level.Blackfoot (left) and Jackson (right) glaciers, both in the mountains of Glacier National Park, were joined along their margins in 1914, but have since retreated into separate alpine cirques. The melting of glacial ice is a major contributor to sea level rise. [ by E. B. Stebinger, Glacier National Park archives (1911), and Lisa McKeon, USGS (2009).]Throughout the hydrologic cycle, there are many paths that a water molecule might follow. Water at the bottom of Lake Superior may eventually rise into the atmosphere and fall as rain in Massachusetts. Runoff from the Massachusetts rain may drain into the Atlantic Ocean and circulate northeastward toward Iceland, destined to become part of a floe of sea ice, or, after evaporation to the atmosphere and precipitation as snow, part of a glacier.Water molecules can take an immense variety of routes and branching trails that lead them again and again through the three phases of ice, liquid water, and water vapor. For instance, the water molecules that once fell 100 years ago as rain on your great- grandparents’ farmhouse in Iowa might now be falling as snow on your driveway in California.Among the most serious Earth science and environmental policy issues confronting society are the potential changes in the Earth’s water cycle due to climate change. The science community now generally agrees that the Earth’s climate is undergoing changes in response to natural variability, including solar variability, and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Furthermore, agreement is widespread that these changes may profoundly affect atmospheric water vapor concentrations, clouds, precipitation patterns, and runoff and stream flow patterns.Global climate change will affect the water cycle, likely creating perennial droughts in some areas and frequent floods in others. ( ©2008 )For example, as the lower atmosphere becomes warmer, evaporation rates will increase, resulting in an increase in the amount of moisture circulating throughout the troposphere (lower atmosphere). An observed consequence of higher water vapor concentrations is the increased frequency of intense precipitation events, mainly over land areas. Furthermore, because of warmer temperatures, more precipitation is falling as rain rather than snow.One expected effect of climate change will be an increase in precipitation intensity: a larger proportion of rain will fall in a shorter amount of time than it has historically. Blue represents areas where climate models predict an increase in intensity by the end of the 21st century, brown represents a predicted decrease. (Map adapted from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.)In parts of the Northern Hemisphere, an earlier arrival of spring-like conditions is leading to earlier peaks in snowmelt and resulting river flows. As a consequence, seasons with the highest water demand, typically summer and fall, are being impacted by a reduced availability of fresh water.Changes in water runoff into rivers and streams are another expected consequence of climate change by the late 21st Century. This map shows predicted increases in runoff in blue, and decreases in brown and red. (Map by Robert Simmon, using  from Chris Milly, NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.)Warmer temperatures have led to increased drying of the land surface in some areas, with the effect of an increased incidence and severity of drought. The Palmer Drought Severity Index, which is a measure of soil moisture using precipitation measurements and rough estimates of changes in evaporation, has shown that from 1900 to 2002, the Sahel region of Africa has been experiencing harsher drought conditions. This same index also indicates an opposite trend in southern South America and the south central United States.Shifts in the water cycle occurred over the past century due to a combination of natural variations and human forcings. From 1900 to 2002, droughts worsened in Sub-Saharan and southern Africa, eastern Brazil, and Iran (brown). Over the same period western Russia, south-eastern South America, Scandinavia, and the southern United States had less severe droughts (green). (Map adapted from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.)While the brief scenarios described above represent a small portion of the observed changes in the water cycle, it should be noted that many uncertainties remain in the  of future climate. These uncertainties derive from  the sheer complexity of the climate system, insufficient and incomplete data sets, and inconsistent results given by current climate models. However, state of the art (but still incomplete and imperfect) climate models do consistently predict that precipitation will become more variable, with increased risks of drought and floods at different times and places.Orbiting satellites are now collecting data relevant to all aspects of the hydrologic cycle, including evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. NASA even has one satellite, Aqua, named specifically for the information it is collecting about the many components of the water cycle.Aqua launched on May 4, 2002, with six Earth-observing instruments:  the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES).NASA’s Aqua satellite carries a suite of instruments designed primarily to study the water cycle. (NASA image by Marit Jentoft-Nilsen.)Since water vapor is the Earth’s primary greenhouse gas, and it contributes significantly to uncertainties in projections of future global warming, it is critical to understand how it varies in the Earth system. In the first years of the Aqua mission, AIRS, AMSU, and HSB provided space-based measurements of atmospheric temperature and water vapor that were more accurate than any obtained before; the sensors also made measurements from more altitudes than any previous sensor. The HSB is no longer operational, but the AIRS/AMSU system continues to provide high-quality atmospheric temperature and water vapor measurements.Aqua’s AIRS and AMSU instruments measure relative humidity at multiple pressure levels, which correspond to altitude. Near the surface (100 kPa), the air above the ocean is almost saturated with water, while it is dry above Australia. It is generally drier higher in the atmosphere (60 kPa), except where convection lifts moisture aloft. At the lower edge of the stratosphere (10 kPa) the air is almost universally dry. (NASA maps by Robert Simmon, based on AIRS/AMSU data.)More recent studies using AIRS data have demonstrated that most of the warming caused by carbon dioxide does not come directly from carbon dioxide, but rather from increased water vapor and other factors that amplify the initial warming. Other  have shown improved estimation of the landfall of a hurricane in the Bay of Bengal by incorporating AIRS temperature measurements, and improved understanding of large-scale atmospheric patterns such as the In addition to their importance to our weather, clouds play a major role in regulating Earth’s climate system. MODIS, CERES, and AIRS all collect data relevant to the study of clouds. The cloud data include the height and area of clouds, the liquid water they contain, and the sizes of cloud droplets and ice particles. The size of cloud particles affects how they reflect and absorb incoming sunlight, and the reflectivity (albedo) of clouds plays a major role in High, thin cirrus clouds reflect relatively little sunlight back into space compared to the amount reflected by thick cumulus clouds. This map shows the reflectivity of cirrus clouds [with a maximum of 30 percent (shown in white)] during March of 2010. (Map by Robert Simmon, using  from the )One of the many variables AMSR-E monitors is global precipitation. The sensor measures microwave energy, some of which passes through clouds, and so the sensor can detect the rainfall even under the clouds.Water in the atmosphere is hardly the only focus of the Aqua mission. Among much else, AMSR-E and MODIS are being used to study sea ice. Sea ice is important to the Earth system not just as an important element in the habitat of polar bears, penguins, and some species of seals, but also because it can insulate the underlying liquid water against heat loss to the often frigid overlying polar atmosphere and because it reflects sunlight that would otherwise be available to warm the ocean.When it comes to sea ice, AMSR-E and MODIS provide complementary information. AMSR-E doesn’t record as much detail about ice features as MODIS does, but it can distinguish ice versus open water even when it is cloudy. The AMSR-E measurements continue, with improved resolution and accuracy, a satellite record of changes in the extent of polar ice that extends back to the 1970s.AMSR-E and MODIS also provide monitoring of snow coverage over land, another key indicator of climate change. As with sea ice, AMSR-E allows routine monitoring of the snow, irrespective of cloud cover, but with less spatial detail,  while MODIS sees  greater spatial detail, but only under cloud-free conditions.As for liquid water on land, AMSR-E provides information about soil moisture, which is crucial for vegetation including agricultural crops. AMSR-E’s monitoring of soil moisture globally permits, for example, the early identification of signs of drought.Aqua is the most comprehensive of NASA’s water cycle missions, but it isn’t alone. In fact, the Terra satellite also has MODIS and CERES instruments onboard, and several other spacecraft have made or are making unique water-cycle measurements.The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) was launched in January 2003, and it collected data  on the topography of the Earth’s ice sheets, clouds, vegetation, and the thickness of sea ice off and on until October 2009. A new ICESat mission, ICESat-2, is now under development and is scheduled to launch in 2015.ICESat’s precise observation of the surface elevation of Arctic sea ice enabled measurement of ice thickness. These images show that sea ice thinned from fall 2003 to fall 2008. Dark blue areas are thin ice, white areas are thick ice, gray regions are land, and light blue south of the ice pack represents open water. (NASA  by the NASA GSFC  using  data.)The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) is a unique mission that consists of two spacecraft orbiting one behind the other;  changes in the distance between the two provide information about the gravity field on the Earth below. Because gravity depends on mass, some of the changes in gravity over time signal a shift in water from one place on Earth to another. Through measurements of changing gravity fields, GRACE scientists are able to derive information about changes in the mass of ice sheets and glaciers and even changes in groundwater around the world.These GRACE data show monthly gravity differences calculated from a 2003-2007 baseline. The big contrasts in the Amazon are due to seasonal changes in rainfall. (NASA maps by Robert Simmon, using )CloudSat is advancing scientists’ understanding of cloud abundance, distribution, structure, and radiative properties (how they absorb and emit energy, including thermal infrared energy escaping from Earth’s surface). Since 2006, CloudSat has flown the first satellite-based, millimeter-wavelength cloud radar—an instrument that is 1000 times more sensitive than existing weather radars on the ground. Unlike ground-based weather radars that use centimeter wavelengths to detect raindrop-sized particles, CloudSat’s radar allows the detection of the much smaller particles of liquid water and ice in the large cloud masses that contribute significantly to our weather.CloudSat’s radar measures the vertical distribution of clouds, such as this profile of Hurricane Julia. (NASA image by Jesse Allen, based on  and  data.)The joint NASA and French Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) is providing new insight into the role that clouds and atmospheric aerosols (particles like dust and pollution) play in regulating Earth’s weather, climate, and air quality. CALIPSO combines an active laser instrument with passive infrared and visible imagers to probe the vertical structure and properties of thin clouds and aerosols over the globe.CloudSat (top) and CALIPSO (lower) are two satellites providing detailed views of the structure of clouds. (NASA images by Marit Jentoft-Nilsen.)

        "content": "NASA is preparing for the first of many flights of the agency’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. Every day we’re making progress toward their first integrated test flight. Today, that work is taking place at numerous sites around the country, but the work of that nationwide team is firmly focused on one place – the launch pad.Hundreds of companies across every state have been a part of SLS and the Orion crew spacecraft, many of them small businesses providing specialized components or services. That work comes together at NASA and prime contractor facilities where the “big pieces” are assembled before it all comes together on the launch pad at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.Some of the pieces have a relatively direct route to the launch pad. At Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, where the SLS program is managed, for example, the flight unit for the Orion Stage Adapter (OSA) that will connect the SLS second stage to the crew spacecraft is being welded, and welding will begin next month on the Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter (LVSA) that will connect the core and second stages. When completed, the LVSA will travel by barge to the gigantic Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, where final stacking of SLS and Orion will take place. The smaller OSA has the option of barge or truck, and after arriving in Florida, will make a stop at a facility where 13 CubeSats will be installed before continuing on to the VAB.Half an hour away, the second stage of the rocket, the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), is being completed at the United Launch Alliance facility in Decatur, Alabama. The process for the ICPS will be one step longer – after being barged from Decatur to Florida, the stage will be prepared for flight at a payload processing facility before being moved to the VAB for stacking.Propellant is already being cast into booster segments for the first flight of SLS. The boosters will be transported by train from an Orbital ATK facility in Utah to Florida. Since the 17-story-tall boosters are far too long to be transported in one piece, the boosters will be transported in segments. They’ll arrive at a processing facility at Kennedy before being moved to the VAB where they’ll be stacked vertically and joined by the rest of the rocket.This one’s a little more complicated. RS-25 core stage engines are currently in inventory at Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, where engine testing is taking place. The core stage hardware for the first launch of SLS is currently being welded at Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The engines for the first flight will be transported from Stennis to Michoud, and integrated into the first core stage when it’s completed. The core stage with engines will then be transported back to Stennis, where the 212-foot-tall stage-and-engine assembly will be placed into a test stand and all four engines will be fired together in the largest liquid-engine ground test since Apollo. After the test, plans call for the stage to be shipped to Kennedy by barge, where it will be brought to the VAB for assembly with the rest of the rocket.Once all of the elements have arrived at the VAB, they’ll be stacked vertically and prepared for launch. The large crawler transporter will bring the mobile launcher with tower to the rocket, and will then carry rocket and launcher together to the launch pad. Which leaves only one last step:NASA is on track for the first mission to launch no later than November 2018 from Florida. The first test flight of SLS and Orion will be incredible, and it will pave the way for our second exploration mission – our first with crew aboard the spacecraft. As these missions continue to come together, we’re closer to sending astronauts to Red Planet than at other point in our history. All the work we’re doing together today will continue to enable that journey in the future.They came for an awesome display of pure propulsive power.They got a lesson in the realities of spaceflight. …Followed by an awesome display of pure propulsive power.While engineers in Utah prepared for the second Qualification Motor (QM-2) test of a Space Launch System (SLS) solid rocket booster, another team of NASA engineers from Marshall Space Flight Center visited the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama to give a presentation to Space Camp trainees and museum guests explaining what would be happening during the test, how the boosters work, what the next steps are to get the boosters ready for the first launch, and how Space Launch System will play a key role in NASA’s Journey to Mars.The museum, which is home to Space Camp, is practically in the backyard of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, where SLS is managed. On the morning of the test, museum attendees and Space Camp trainees filled a theater at the museum to watch the two-minute-long firing of the 17-story solid rocket booster, the most powerful ever built for human spaceflight. The firing would provide information to answer 82 questions about how the booster performs, including how it would respond in cold-weather conditions.What they ended up seeing that day was a huge milestone for the Space Launch System and a major step toward human exploration of deep space. The motor performed as anticipated for the burn. The inside of the motor, where the propellant had been cooled to 40 degrees Fahrenheit to simulate a cold day at the launch site, reached nearly 6,000 degrees, and the flames leaving the booster melted sand into glass. The test clears the way for qualification of the solid rocket boosters as ready to fly on the first launch of SLS in 2018.In addition to the test and presentation, they also got a real-life lesson on the challenges in developing and flying space systems. As hundreds of children took their seats, the live NASA TV feed appeared on the giant theater screen, showing the booster mounted in the test stand – and the word “hold” underneath it.A technical issue had delayed the test – a problem with a sequencing computer. When one listens to the audio feed of a rocket or shuttle launch, you can hear announcements of the steps being taken as the countdown clock nears zero – “vehicle is on internal power,” “main engines start,” etc. For a rocket to launch, numerous things have to all happen properly, and all in the correct order, one event paving the way for the next. The booster test required that same sort of preparation and precision – many things had to happen properly, and in the proper order, both before and after ignition of the booster. When the computer responsible for managing that sequence failed to function correctly, the test had to be delayed.From a big picture view, the delay was relatively minor – after a discussion on how best to proceed, the software was changed out, the clock was reset, and the test took place just one hour after it was originally scheduled.During the delay, the audience heard the NASA team’s presentation and got a big-screen viewing of last year’s first qualification motor test (QM-1) test. But they also got a real-world demonstration of what they’d been learning in Space Camp – the best word you can hear in the space business is “nominal,” meaning everything is proceeding as expected, but there are sometimes you don’t hear that word. You work as hard as you can to make sure that you do, and you work as hard as you can to be prepared for when you don’t. When an “off-nominal” challenge arose, the NASA and Orbital ATK team in Utah rapidly assessed the problem, identified options for moving forward, evaluated the risks and benefits, and implemented a solution that allowed the test to proceed quickly and successfully.While some of the original attendees had to leave in favor of hands-on activities like microgravity water-tank training, when the test took place, the remaining audience counted down to the firing, and cheered when the booster ignited and extinguished, the giant screen showing the close-up shots at almost life size and the sound system doing its best to do justice to the roar of the motor as it turned desert sand into glass. There was excitement over the observation that the next time a booster like this is lit, it will be powering SLS off the launch pad for its first flight.The one QM-2 solid rocket motor, by itself, produced more thrust than it takes to lift most rockets off the ground and send them into space, and required millions of pounds of concrete in the test facility to make sure it didn’t move.Next time, there will be nothing holding it back.On Monday, the United States celebrated the Fourth of July. Fireworks and backyard grills were ignited across the country.A couple hundred miles above us, the International Space Station orbited Earth with two spacecraft attached to it.What do these two things have in common? A quest for independence.The Fourth of July, of course, is the United States’ Independence Day, celebrating the anniversary of the 1776 signing of the Declaration of Independence, announcing that the former colonies were becoming a sovereign nation.The International Space Station is an early, but prominent step in NASA’s effort to achieve “Earth independence” in human deep-space exploration, a key part of our Journey to Mars. On the station, we are learning how to live off the Earth by conducting investigations to learn how the human body adapts to space and testing new technologies needed for longer missions. However, the two spacecraft docked to the space station demonstrate that our human spaceflight operations today are “Earth dependent.” While astronauts float freely in the microgravity aboard the station, they remain tethered to our planet by a supply chain of provisions needed to survive. Deliveries of food, science experiments, spare parts and gifts from home arrive and depart by spacecraft on a regularly scheduled basis. Earlier this year, the number of docked spacecraft reached six: American Dragon and Cygnus cargo ships, and Russian Progress cargo ships and Soyuz crew vehicles. Should something go wrong, the return to Earth is only a short distance away.In order to travel to Mars, astronauts will have to survive without that tether. When they depart Earth, they will sail into the void of space without the comfort of frequent visits from resupply ships. They will have no quick return; should something break or go wrong, Earth is potentially more than a year away. These pioneers will rely on themselves and what they have with them, or what has been sent ahead. They will be the first to be independent of our home planet, with both the freedom and responsibility that carries with it.Significant challenges await us as we move from Earth dependence into Earth independence, learning to operate in space in a way we never have before. To accomplish this, we will carry out “proving ground” missions – missions where we will, innovate, test, and validate new systems and capabilities that will help us learn to live longer and farther away from home. The first launch of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket with the Orion crew vehicle will mark our entry into this proving ground era, relying on new systems farther from Earth than any human spaceflight mission has ever ventured. SLS and Orion will allow us to launch habitats and other equipment that will support the first astronauts to not only visit, but to live in deep space around and beyond our moon.When we have demonstrated the ability to live and thrive in deep space, the time will come for the first mission to leave the neighborhood of the Earth and moon and extend human existence into the solar system, a mission that will not only be a major step toward human landings on Mars but will be our declaration of Earth-independence.In that moment, the word “Independence” will designate the time when humankind became an interplanetary species.Get the grills and fireworks ready, because that will be an occasion to celebrate.If you compared NASA’s powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rocket to a human body, the avionics and software would be the nervous system and brain that monitor the body’s condition and makes and sends decisions. Just a few of the hundreds of operations that they make include: liquid propellant flow, engine throttling, engine and booster exhaust nozzle steering, trajectory updates, receiving and sending data to the crew and ground control, and responding to off-nominal issues such as wind gusts or an engine failure.The avionics are required to work in environments of temperature, pressure, sound, etc. that no human body – and actually few machines – could tolerate. So everything from the boxes, to the boards, to the individual processors are “ruggedized” and tested at every step in development to survive launch.Ultimately the avionics boxes and software have to work perfectly. But how can you be sure without putting it on the world’s largest rocket and seeing how it works? That’s the focus of the Integrated Avionics Test Facility – or IATF – at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, where the computer, routers, processors, power, and other black boxes and software collectively known as “avionics” are being tested in preparation for the planned 2018 first flight of SLS.Possibly the coolest thing about the test facility is that it can create an artificial vehicle operating in an artificial world and virtually “fly” SLS hundreds of times – from pre-launch activation and checkout to liftoff to core stage separation at about 17,500 miles per hour and 100 miles in space – to test the entire avionics package.Avionics can be found all over SLS: in the booster aft skirt and forward skirt, the core stage engine controllers mounted on the engines themselves, in the core stage engine section, intertank, and forward skirt, in the launch vehicle stage adapter, and in the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage. Of course, avionics for the Orion crew vehicle are also linked in to the performance of the whole vehicle. So basically top to bottom.Inside the test facility, the vehicle avionics boxes are mounted on a semi-circular, 18-foot-tall frame in the same relative position they will be inside SLS – right down to the length of the connecting cables. Outside the frame, several large towers house the equipment for simulating the SLS “world” and running test after test.The virtual world of SLS is created by a pair of software tools, ARTEMIS and MAESTRO. They stand for A Real-Time Environment for Modeling, Integration and Simulation (ARTEMIS) and Managed Automation Environment for Simulation, Test, and Real-Time Operations (MAESTRO). (How do engineers come up with this stuff?) ARTEMIS is a suite of computer models, simulations and hardware interfaces that simulates the SLS and its virtual “world.” For instance, it simulates the Earth’s rotation, gravity, propellant tank sloshing, vehicle bending in flight, engine and booster pressure, temperature and thrust, and weather, from hot sunny days to cold stormy nights, and inputs from the Orion crew vehicle and launch facilities. In fact, ARTEMIS has far more lines of software code than SLS itself. MAESTRO serves as the test conductor for the virtual missions. This software configures and controls test operations, sets up the external conditions, monitors the tests, and archives all test data for analysis. That’s where engineers and software writers find out if their code needs fixing or supplementing.The actual flight avionics for SLS will never be tested in this facility – only their flight-like equivalents. The actual flight avionics will be installed directly into the core stage at the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana and tested there prior to flight. The test team at Marshall can already say that they’ve flown SLS “virtually” thousands of time to help ensure that SLS flies safely on its first real mission in a couple of years.For two monumental minutes on June 28, the Space Launch System (SLS) solid rocket boosters — the largest ever built for flight — will fire up in an amazing display of power as engineers verify their designs in the last full-scale test before SLS’s first flight in late 2018.  and each major test — like this one, dubbed QM-2 — puts NASA one step closer on its Journey to Mars.The smoke and fire may last only two minutes, but engineers at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama and Orbital ATK in Promontory, Utah have been preparing weeks — even months — in advance for  Here’s a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into getting ready to fire up the largest and most powerful solid rocket motor ever built for flight.. In the months prior to the test, propellant-filled segments began arriving at Orbital ATK’s Test Bay T-97 after being cast in nearby facilities. Many of these segments are veterans of space shuttle flights. In fact, the various metal case segments that comprise the five-segment QM-2 motor flew on 48 shuttle flights! In the two weeks leading up to the test, Orbital ATK engineers begin dry runs that simulate the final test as closely as possible (without the smoke and fire). They put the motor and associated systems through their paces no fewer than 11 times before the big day to ensure not only that all systems are functioning as expected, but also that the test will be executed properly. “We only get one shot at firing the rocket motor,” says Dr. Janica Cheney, Orbital ATK’s director of Test Operations. “All the dry runs and other preparations that take place ahead of time are critical to ensuring we get the data we need from this test firing.” For this final full-scale static test, engineers have 82 goals, or test objectives, they need to measure and evaluate. One day before the test, it’s crunch time; caffeine’s flowing as engineers work around the clock the day before the test to ensure all systems function properly and all necessary data can be collected. Game day. There’s focus — and excitement. There are two more dry runs leading up to the test. Engineers, technicians and operators are “on station,” — present and accounted for at key locations such as the test bay, the instrument rooms and the control bunker. When you hear “control bunker,” think mission control — a command and control center that directs every aspect of the test, similar to what you see at mission control during a launch. Time flies during the final eight hours before the test. At 4:05 a.m. EDT (2:05 a.m. MDT), engineers and managers at Orbital ATK and NASA will make a “go” or “no go” decision on testing that day. Assuming the test’s a go, technicians “roll back” Orbital ATK’s specially designed moveable test bay housing and begin running final checks to make sure everything is ready. “We check the status of all the data and control systems, the test bay, the motor preparation and weather conditions,” Cheney says.Weather is one variable that can halt the QM-2 test. “We make sure there’s no lightning in the area; no high winds; no storms,” explains Orbital ATK Fire Chief Blair Westergard. “We also establish fire breaks. Along with the Box Elder County Fire District, we’re prepared to extinguish any secondary wildfires too.”Engineers also make sure cameras are ready to film and all data recording systems are online and functioning properly. Orbital ATK Security ensures the area around the test is clear. Crowds begin to gather as the public viewing area near Promontory off State Route 83 opens at 7:30 a.m. EDT (5:30 a.m. MDT). Orbital ATK Security directs traffic with the help of the Utah Highway Patrol and provides crowd control support to ensure everything remains orderly — vital when 10,000 people are in attendance.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-xrhYKC0q4[/embedyt] The formal countdown commences; the public address system broadcast begins. The crew in the test bay begins final procedures to prepare the booster for testing. Final system and timing checks are underway.A “go for test” announcement sounds from the public address system.. A siren begins; it will blare through T minus 20 seconds. The “Safe and Arm” system sequence begins, which arms the motor. The Safe and Arm device is remotely activated from the “safe” position into the “armed” position, allowing the motor to ignite when the “fire” command is given. At 10:05 a.m. EDT (8:05 MDT), two minutes of pure awesome commence as the gigantic motor burns through about five and a half tons of propellant each second during the approximately two-minute test. Inside the control bunker, there will be jubilation — and relief. “This is serious business — this is rocket science,” Cheney emphasizes. “But there’s nothing better than the smoke and fire and the data that comes with it when you’ve had a successful day. Our success is NASA’s success — we don’t do it alone.”The countdown to the last full-scale test firing of the massive Space Launch System (SLS) solid rocket boosters has begun. Mark your calendars: June 28, 8:05 a.m. MDT.Expect two minutes of shock and awesome as the flight-like motor burns through about six tons of propellant each second during the test. With expanding gases and flames exiting the nozzle at speeds in excess of Mach 3 and temperatures reaching 3,700 degrees Fahrenheit, say goodbye to some of the sand at Orbital ATK’s test facility in the Utah desert because after the test, the sand at the aft, or rear, end of the booster motor will be .The 154-foot long Qualification Motor 2 (QM-2) consists of the five propellant-filled segments in the middle of the booster; the aft skirt is also part of the test, but the forward assembly (nose cap, forward skirt) won’t be. (See our  if you need a refresher on booster parts and assemblies). The test will broadcast live on  and our  page. We will also live tweet from  on Twitter.For those watching at home (or work), here are three cool things that might not be so obvious on the screen, in countdown order. — literally, down to 40 degrees — since the first week in May in Orbital ATK’s “test bay housing,” a special building on rails that moves to enclose the booster and rolls back so the motor can be test-fired. Even though SLS will launch from the normally balmy Kennedy Space Center in Florida, temperatures can vary there and engineers need to be sure the booster will perform as expected whether the propellant inside the motor is 40 degrees or 90 degrees (the temperature of the propellant during the first full-scale test,  or QM-1).If you happen to be near Promontory, Utah on June 28, you can view the test for yourself in the public viewing area off State Route 83. And don’t worry, this booster’s not going anywhere — engineers have it locked down. The motor is held securely in place by Orbital ATK’s T-97 test stand.During the test, the motor will push against a forward thrust block with more than three million pounds of force. Holding down the rocket motor is more than 13 million pounds of concrete — most of which is underground. The test stand contains a system of load cells that enable engineers to measure the thrust the motor produces and verify their predictions.Putting out the fire at the end of the test is the job of the quench system, which fills the motor with carbon dioxide from both ends of the test stand. A deluge system sprays water on the motor to keep the metal case from getting too hot so the hardware can be re-used. Both the quench and deluge systems had to be upgraded to handle the heat and size of the big five-segment boosters.These solid rocket boosters are the largest and most powerful ever built for flight. They’ve been tested and retested in both full-scale and smaller subsystem-level tests. Engineers have upgraded and revamped vital parts like the nozzle, insulation and avionics control systems. They’ve analyzed loads and thrust, run models and simulations, and are nearing the end of verifying their designs will work as expected.Most of this work was necessary because, plainly put, SLS needs bigger boosters. Bigger boosters mean bolder missions – like around the moon during the first integrated mission of SLS and Orion. So the next time we see these solid rocket motors fire, they will be propelling SLS off the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and on its first flight with Orion. For real.How do you put the world’s largest rocket under a microscope?One piece at a time, of course.NASA’s  – SLS – will be the world’s most powerful, capable rocket. It will send intrepid explorers, their spacecraft, their landers, their habitats, and all their other equipment to survive and thrive in deep space.But, first, it has to survive launch. SLS is an extreme machine for operating in extreme environments – 6 million pounds going from zero to around 17,500 miles per hour in just 8 minutes or so after liftoff. Some parts are minus 400 degrees F. Some parts are 5,000 degrees. Extreme.So NASA works hard to make sure everything works as planned, including the largest part, the  – 212 feet long, 27 feet in diameter, and weighing more than 2 million pounds all gassed up and ready to go.NASA and core stage prime contractor Boeing are building hardware at Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana for the first flight in 2018. Engineers have put the design through numerous computerized structural analyses and simulations, but that’s not the same as actually , etc. on new manufacturing tools with new processes for the first time. Each time, the team starts to weld new flight hardware, they methodically go through a series of steps to make sure that first flight hardware is perfect.“Perfect” is a relative term. Some technically-minded people consider welding itself as a defect in a metal structure because the weld is never as strong as the rest of the metal, according to Carolyn Russell, chief of the metal joining and processes branch at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, with 32 years of experience in the field. Given the advanced state of welding technology, other people might consider the term “defect” as a bit extreme.None other than legendary rocket scientist Wernher von Braun declared in the midst of Saturn V moon rocket development in 1966: “A lifetime of rocketry has convinced me that welding is one of the most critical aspects of this whole job.”The first step to SLS flight hardware was establishing the “weld schedule,” – how the welding will be done. SLS uses “friction stir welding” – a super fast rotating pin whipping solid metal pieces until they are the consistency of butter and meld together to bond the core stage’s rings, domes, and barrel segments. The result is a stronger and more defect-free weld, than traditional methods of joining materials with welding torches.Based on the particular aluminum alloy and thickness, engineers establish the required pin rotational speed, travel speed, how hard it pushes on the metal Before committing the welding schedule to full size or flight hardware, the core stage team checks the process on test panels about 2 feet long. Test panels are made at Michoud and sent to Marshall, where they are nondestructively inspected, sectioned and then analyzed microscopically for minute defects.Marshall materials scientists study the samples under magnification in the search for cracks and voids, and to understand how deeply the weld penetrated the parts. They also undergo non-destructive evaluation, including x-ray, ultrasonic, and dye penetrant testing.With weld processes tested for every part of the core stage, the manufacturing team can begin building , or “WCAs.” There are WCAs for the engine section, the liquid oxygen tank, and the liquid hydrogen tank. Likewise, the WCAs are cut into samples that are again put under the microscope at Marshall. In theory, the WCAs should be perfect if the weld schedule was followed. In reality, it doesn’t quite work out.WCA welding consists of lots of “firsts,” Russell explained. It’s a test of the tooling and factors like parts alignment and tolerances. Heat transfer from the welds to the surrounding metal is different once large parts are clamped together. It short, stuff happens. Adjustments are made. Weld samples are cut and again put under the microscope until the weld schedule is perfected.All this testing and microscope-gazing has led to a major SLS milestone: the welding of structural test articles – STAs – and flight articles for the hydrogen and oxygen tanks, engine section, and forward skirt, which is underway now. The STAs will be shipped to Marshall next year. Secured into test stands – that are secured firmly to the ground – these test articles will be rigged with hundreds of sensors and then pushed and prodded to see if they can survive the stresses the flight hardware will experience – accelerating bending, twisting, etc.Then, and only then, can engineers say that the giant core stage is ready for its launch debut. But that’s a story for another day.On the first launch of the Space Launch System (SLS), America’s next-generation heavy-lift rocket, the Orion Stage Adapter (OSA) will carry , or boot box-sized science and technology investigations, that will help pave the way for future human exploration in deep space. Engineers and technicians at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center have built the main structure of this hardware that will be part of the rocket when it lifts off from Launch Complex 39B at NASA’s modernized spaceport at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.The Orion Stage Adapter does exactly what its name indicates: it connects the Orion spacecraft to the second stage of the launch vehicle. Using enormous friction-stir welding machines, engineers just finished welding three large panels into a ring that is 18 feet in diameter and 5 feet high. With this welding complete, it’s time for analysis. The main structural ring is currently undergoing nondestructive analysis using 3-D structured light scanning and photogrammetry, which creates a computer model using photography, to ensure hardware was built to design specification.Next, engineers will trim it, weld upper and lower rings onto the large ring, machine it to final dimensions, apply paint, and install the diaphragm, a barrier that separates SLS from Orion. After that, installation of cables and the brackets that will secure the secondary payloads during their spaceflight will complete this critical piece of flight hardware.The 13 CubeSat secondary payloads will be some of the first small satellites to explore deep space and answer critical questions relevant to NASA’s future exploration plans. These small but mighty scientific investigations include ten satellites from U.S. industry, government, and commercial partners as well as the What do water and aluminum have in common?If you guessed that water and aluminum make SLS fly, give yourself a gold star!Chemistry is at the heart of making rockets fly. Rocket propulsion follows Newton’s Third Law, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. To get a rocket off the launch pad, create a chemical reaction that shoots gas and particles out one end of the rocket and the rocket will go the other way.What kind of chemical reaction gets hot gases shooting out of the business end of a rocket with enough velocity to unshackle it from Earth’s gravity? Combustion.Whether it’s your personal vehicle or a behemoth launch vehicle like SLS, the basics are the same. Combustion (burning something) releases energy, which makes things go. Start with fuel (something to burn) and an oxidizer (something to make it burn) and now you’ve got propellant. Give it a spark and energy is released, along with some byproducts.For SLS to fly, combustion takes place in two primary areas: the main engines (four Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-25s) and the twin solid rocket boosters (built by Orbital ATK) that provide more than 75 percent of thrust at liftoff. Combustion powers both propulsion systems, but the fuels and oxidizers are different.The RS-25 main engines are called “liquid engines” because the fuel is liquid hydrogen (LH2). Liquid oxygen (LOX) serves as the oxidizer. The boosters, on the other hand, use aluminum as fuel with ammonium perchlorate as the oxidizer, mixed with a binder that creates one homogenous solid propellant.Hydrogen, the fuel for the main engines, is the lightest element and normally exists as a gas. Gases – especially lightweight hydrogen – are low-density, which means a little of it takes up a lot of space. To have enough to power a large combustion reaction would require an incredibly large tank to hold it – the opposite of what’s needed for an aerodynamically designed launch vehicle.To get around this problem, turn the hydrogen gas into a liquid, which is denser than a gas. This means cooling the hydrogen to a temperature of ‑423 degrees Fahrenheit (‑253 degrees Celsius). Seriously cold.Although it’s denser than hydrogen, oxygen also needs to be compressed into a liquid to fit in a smaller, lighter tank. To transform oxygen into its liquid state, it is cooled to a temperature of ‑297 degrees Fahrenheit (‑183 degrees Celsius). While that’s balmy compared to LH2, both propellant ingredients need special handling at these temperatures. What’s more, the cryogenic LH2 and LOX evaporate quickly at ambient pressure and temperature, meaning the rocket can’t be loaded with propellant until a few hours before launch.Once in the tanks and with the launch countdown nearing zero, the LH2 and LOX are pumped into the combustion chamber of each engine. When the propellant is ignited, the hydrogen reacts explosively with oxygen to form: water! Elementary!This “green” reaction releases massive amounts of energy along with superheated water (steam). The hydrogen-oxygen reaction generates tremendous heat, causing the water vapor to expand and exit the engine nozzles at speeds of 10,000 miles per hour! All that fast-moving steam creates the thrust that propels the rocket from Earth.But it’s not just the environmentally friendly water reaction that makes cryogenic LH2 a fantastic rocket fuel. It’s all about impulse – . This measure of the efficiency of rocket fuel describes the amount of thrust per amount of fuel burned. The higher the specific impulse, the more “push off the pad” you get per each pound of fuel.The LH2-LOX propellant has the highest specific impulse of any commonly used rocket fuel, and the incredibly efficient RS-25 engine gets great gas mileage out of an already efficient fuel.But even though LH2 has the highest specific impulse, because of its low density, carrying enough LH2 to fuel the reaction needed to leave Earth’s surface would require a tank too big, too heavy and with too much insulation protecting the cryogenic propellant to be practical.To get around that, designers gave SLS a boost. How the solid rocket boosters use aluminum – the same stuff you use to cover your leftovers – to provide enough thrust to get SLS off the ground.Earlier this month, another successful test firing of a Space Launch System (SLS) RS-25 engine was conducted at Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. Engine testing is a vital part of making sure SLS is ready for its . How do the engines handle the higher thrust level they’ll need to produce for an SLS launch? Is the new engine controller computer ready for the task of a dynamic SLS launch? What happens when if you increase the pressure of the propellant flowing into the engine? SLS will produce more thrust at launch than any rocket NASA’s ever flown, and the power and  put a lot of demands on the engines. Testing gives us confidence that the upgrades we’re making to the engines have prepared them to meet those demands.If you read about the test – and you are following us on , right? – you probably heard that the engine being used in this test was the first “flight” engine, both in the sense that it is an engine that has flown before, and is an engine that is already scheduled for flight on SLS. You may not have known that within the SLS program, each of the RS-25 engines for our first four flights is a distinct individual, with its own designation and history. Here are five other things you may not have known about the engine NASA and RS-25 prime contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne tested this month, engine 2059. – In 2009, the space shuttle made its final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, STS-125. Spaceflight fans excited by the mission called themselves “Hubble Huggers,” including STS-125 crew member John Grunsfeld, today the head of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. Along with two other engines, 2059 powered space shuttle Atlantis into orbit for the successful Hubble servicing mission. In addition to its Hubble flight, engine 2059 also made four visits to the International Space Station, including the STS-130 mission that delivered the cupola from which station crew members can observe Earth below them. – The first flight of SLS will include an engine that flew on STS-135, the final flight of the space shuttle, in 2011. So if the first flight of SLS includes an engine that flew on the last flight of shuttle, it only makes sense that on the second flight of SLS, there will be an engine that flew on the second-to-last flight of shuttle, right? Engine 2059 last flew on STS-134, the penultimate shuttle flight, in May 2011, and will next fly on SLS Exploration Mission-2. – As an engine that flew on a Hubble servicing mission, engine 2059 has already been higher than the average flight of an RS-25. Hubble orbits Earth at an altitude of about 350 miles, more than 100 miles higher than the average orbit of the International Space Station. But on its next flight, 2059 will fly almost three times higher than that – the EM-2 core stage and engines will reach a peak altitude of almost 1,000 miles! – The test of engine 2059 gave the SLS program valuable information about the engine, but it also provided unique information about the test stand. Because 2059 is a flown engine, we have data about its past testing performance. Prior to the first SLS RS-25 engine test series last year, the A1 test stand at Stennis had gone through modifications. Comparing the data from 2059’s previous testing with the test this month provides calibration data for the test stand. – In 2014, participants in a NASA Social at Stennis Space Center and Michoud Assembly Facility, outside of New Orleans, got to tour the engine facility at Stennis, and had the opportunity to have their picture made with one of the enginesnone other than 2059. NASA Social participants have seen other SLS hardware, toured the booster fabrication facility at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and watched an RS-25 engine test at Stennis and a solid rocket booster test at Orbital ATK in Utah.

        "content": "The signature of drought was easy to read in the southern United States in the summer of 2011. It was in the         brown, wilted crops and the bare fields. It was in the clouds of dust that rolled across the sky and in the         shrinking reservoirs. It was in the fires that raced through crisp grasslands and forests, devouring homes and         wilderness. It was in the oppressive heat that returned day after day.Two ranchers walk across the plains of drought-stricken West Texas in July 2011. (             courtesy U.S. Department of Agriculture.)Drought was harder to see as 2011 drew to a close. With the return of winter, rains began to fall and         temperatures dropped. But the drought was still there, lingering beneath the surface. It was still apparent to         hydrologists who test the wells that plunge deep into underground aquifers.This lingering, subtle drought was also visible to a highly unusual pair of satellites.In Nebraska, Brian Wardlow and colleagues at the National Drought Mitigation Center watched the drought long         before and after the average citizen paid heed. Wardlow develops satellite-based products that experts use—along         with more traditional ground observations—to assess the severity of drought. Looking at measurements from         the satellites, Wardlow could see broad-scale changes in groundwater supplies at varying depths over large         swaths of the South.Measurements of underground water storage (aquifers)—rather than surface water (lakes, rivers, etc.)—reveal             the long-term effects of drought. This map shows ground water conditions in the U.S. during the week of             November 28, 2011, compared to the long-term average. A  shows the evolution of ground water from 2002 to 2012. (Map by Chris Poulsen,  based on data from the GRACE science team.)After a year without much rain, it was no surprise that the drought lingered below the land’s surface.         “Groundwater takes a long time to be depleted, but it takes a long time to be recharged as well,”         says Wardlow, a remote sensing specialist at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. From experience, he         expected regional groundwater supplies to be diminished. But this time he could see it in greater detail than         traditional well measurements had ever provided.Observing the water buried beneath layers of soil and rock was no small thing. When the twin satellites known as         the  or GRACE, were         launched in March 2002, few hydrologists believed they could see—no less measure—changes in         groundwater. But at least two scientists did: Jay Famiglietti and his graduate student Matt Rodell, who were         working at that time at the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin).The twin GRACE satellites launched on March 17, 2002, aboard a Russian rocket. (Image courtesy NASA JPL.)Now a scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Rodell has spent the past decade studying         groundwater with GRACE and working to make those measurements useful to decision-makers. Thanks largely to         Famiglietti, Rodell, and a handful of other scientists, GRACE’s measurements of groundwater, ice, and         oceans are now so essential that NASA is preparing to launch a follow-on mission.“Hydrologists were slow to embrace GRACE because its data were unlike anything they had ever seen before,”         says Rodell. GRACE isn’t a probe that can be buried in the ground to measure water directly. It isn’t         even a standard satellite that takes pictures of the ground.In fact, raw data from GRACE are nothing but a series of measurements showing how far apart two satellites are.         The twin satellites follow each other in orbit around the Earth, separated by 200 kilometers (120 miles) or so.         They constantly send microwave signals to each other to measure the distance between them.On a more sophisticated level, GRACE measures gravity, the force that anchors us to the planet. Gravity is an         attraction between two objects—such as a human and the Earth—and its strength varies depending on         how much mass those objects have and how far apart they are. For example, the tug of gravity is weaker for a         person on the Moon than on the Earth because Earth is more massive.“GRACE is not  the ground,” says Famiglietti, now at the University of         California-Irvine. “It’s  the ground.”Earth’s gravity varies from place to place, determined in part by elevation, the thickness of the             crust, and the density of different substances. (NASA map by Robert Simmon, using data from the )Our senses perceive gravity as constant on Earth, but it actually varies slightly from location to location; it         also changes as mass shifts. When the GRACE satellites encounter a change in the distribution of Earth’s         mass—say a huge blanket of fresh snow on California’s Sierra Nevada—they are pulled toward the         mountains a tiny bit more than normal. The leading satellite responds first, changing the distance between the         two satellites. Instruments on the satellites record this change in separation to within one-one hundredth of         the width of a human hair. By tracking trends in how the satellites’ orbits change, scientists and         engineers can calculate how gravity is changing on Earth.So when groundwater supplies dwindled in the southern United States in 2011, that region of the planet had a         little less mass. The satellite orbits moved a bit in response. GRACE data revealed the change in groundwater         storage to Wardlow.The measurement of gravity by satellite is as old as the Space Age, notes Srinivas Bettadpur, GRACE’s         science operations manager at UT-Austin. Early engineers, including GRACE principal investigator Byron Tapley         (UT-Austin), detected variations in satellite orbits that could only have been caused by variations in         gravity.“The first thing I tackled in the 1970s was the task of computing the orbits of satellites very accurately         to support satellite altimeter missions,” says Tapley. “We reached the point that we could compute         orbits that had an accuracy of a few centimeters.” Eventually his computations hit a glitch that he couldn’t         fix. The satellite orbits varied seasonally.Tapley and others realized that these subtle shifts in Earth’s gravity occurred primarily because water         moves from one place to another on and under land, in the ocean, and in the atmosphere. In the early days,         Tapley’s orbital variations could capture movement on the scale of a hemisphere. But no one could measure         the subtle, tiny shifts accurately enough to map Earth’s gravity in fine detail.GRACE measures the Earth’s gravity precisely enough to map the seasonal movement of water. This image             shows the yearly change in the Earth’s  The biggest variations occur in the             Amazon, followed by other areas with large changes in rainfall between wet and dry seasons. (NASA map by             Robert Simmon, using data from the University of Colorado )“When we first proposed GRACE, there was a lot of concern about how well we could determine where the         gravity signal is coming from,” says Michael Watkins, the GRACE project scientist at NASA’s Jet         Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). “Could you easily see the difference between a reservoir in North America         versus ice melt in Greenland versus ocean circulation? We did a lot of simulations to convince folks that we         could.”GRACE is able to make accurate measurements thanks in part to two advanced technologies: a microwave ranging         system based on Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, and a very sensitive accelerometer—an         instrument that measures the forces on the satellites besides gravity (such as atmospheric drag).The microwave ranging technology came from NASA’s Deep Space Network, designed by engineers in Watkins’         group at JPL. “The antennas on GRACE are based on the design of the antennas that track spacecraft at Mars         and Jupiter,” says Watkins. The new ranging system was so accurate that an antenna on each satellite could         allow it to track the other’s minutest movement. GPS satellites and receivers on the ground provided         additional measurements of the satellite locations.During each 95-minute orbit, the distance between the GRACE satellites varies by about 2 kilometers (1.2             miles). Instruments aboard the satellites measure the separation to a precision of one micrometer (0.00004             inches). (NASA graph by Robert Simmon and Kevin Ward, using GRACE data from the JPL )The accelerometer measures the forces that move the satellite by pushing on its surface. “The measurement         allows us to correct for anything that is related to drag or solar pressure, leaving just gravity,” says         Watkins.Together, these very precise measurements of location, force, and orbital change translate into an observation of         gravity with unprecedented accuracy. Unlike most satellites, which are put in a  the         GRACE satellites were launched into a high orbit and then largely left alone. Flight engineers only maneuver the         satellites if they separate by more than 250 kilometers. As the satellites circle the Earth, the ranging         technology tells scientists exactly where each satellite is relative to the other. Supercomputers and scientists         compare the positions of the satellites relative to each other and to previous orbits, noting every variation.     To relate changes in satellite motion to changes in gravity, Bettadpur and his team start by examining what the         satellites’ paths ought to look like. They know where the mountains are, and where the oceans grow deep.         They know the path of the Sun and the Moon, and the related fluctuation of ocean tides. They know what large         weather systems have moved through the atmosphere. And they can determine how much all of these things should         pull on the satellites.The researchers use mathematics and fundamental laws of physics to translate measurements of the satellite paths         into measurements of gravity, and the equations are as old as Isaac Newton. Sir Isaac invented calculus to solve         his equations; the GRACE team needs a supercomputer. Located at the Texas Advanced Computation Center, a         supercomputer crunches billions of arithmetic operations on half a million new observations collected every         month. The end result is a single set of numbers that represent how much gravity has shifted compared to         previous months.GRACE measured changes in the Antarctic ice sheet from December 2003 through 2010. Red areas lost mass, while             blue regions gained mass. (NASA map adapted from Luthke et al., 2012.)“The distance between the satellites changes by two to three kilometers during one turn around the Earth,”         says Bettadpur. “And we can account for all but a few millimeters from what we already know. What we don’t         know are things like the water cycle on land or the changing ice sheets, but we think these cause the little bit         of motion we can’t account for.”In the decade since its launch, GRACE has observed a number of significant changes in the water cycle. GRACE         revealed losses in ice mass on Greenland (), Alaska, and Antarctica. The gravity measurements revealed how much the melting         glaciers are contributing to sea level rise by recording both ice lost from land and the mass gained in the         ocean.California’s Central Valley is one of the areas where GRACE detected a decline in             ground water reserves since 2003. (Graph adapted from )Looking at changes in groundwater levels over time, Rodell and Famiglietti have identified a disturbing trend.         “GRACE shows where people are using more water than is naturally available or sustainable,” says         Rodell. “Scientists predicted this trend based on what we know about water use. But until we had GRACE, we         couldn’t quantify it very well for many parts of the world.”“GRACE gives you variations in the total ” confirms Rodell. “But in order to figure out whether those         changes are happening in the ground water, soil moisture, snow, or surface water, we need auxiliary information.         We use physics equations and computer models to figure out what happens to the water after it hits the land as         rain or snow.”In some parts of the world, particularly the tropics, most of the water is stored on the surface in lakes,         rivers, and wetlands. In cold regions, water mostly accumulates as snow and ice. In the temperate middle         latitudes (including most of the United States), soils and aquifers are the major stores of water.In the top layer of the soil, the spaces between the soil grains are filled with air and water, explains         Famiglietti. Gravity pulls the water down into the Earth, so as you go progressively deeper in the soil, the         pore spaces become more and more full. When water fills every pore, the soil is saturated.Scientists combine GRACE data with ground-based measurements to map water at the surface, in the root zone,             and stored in ground water. These maps compare conditions during the week of August 20, 2012, to the             long-term average from 1948 to the present. For example, dark red regions represent dry conditions that             should occur only 2 percent of the time (once every 50 years).               (Maps by Chris Poulsen,  at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, based on data from Matt Rodell,             NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and the GRACE science team.)This saturation point is the top of the “water table,” where groundwater is stored. The distinction         between soil moisture (the unsaturated zone) and groundwater (the saturated zone) is important because         groundwater flows easily enough for people to tap with wells and pumps. It is much harder to get water from         unsaturated soil.One way Rodell distinguishes between snow, surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater is a process of         elimination. He also assembles data on how much rain or snow has fallen at each location, the soil type, amount         of sunlight, wind speed, and other meteorological variables, and combines them within a land surface model. This         computer model uses hundreds of equations to determine the fate of energy from the Sun and of water after that         energy hits the land surface. The results include maps of groundwater, soil moisture, and evaporation, and how         they all vary over time.While the societal and scientific value of groundwater measurements from space was always clear, scientists were         initially hesitant to trust GRACE. “We claimed we could measure water under the ground,” says Byron         Tapley. “The ability to penetrate the Earth from space is a paradigm shift for a community of hydrologists         who are used to measuring underground water from wells.”A United States Geological Survey researcher measures groundwater levels in a well near Oakland, Nebraska.             ( courtesy USGS             )To convince them that GRACE was indeed measuring groundwater, the science team set out to find a location without         water. “We tried to do a test to show that there was no gravity signal over very dry regions,” says         Tapley. The perfect candidate would be the world’s largest desert: the Sahara. The test didn’t work:         “It turned out that there’s a fairly large aquifer under the Sahara Desert.”So instead of looking for a place where there was little ground water, the team turned their attention to where         there was a lot. One of the largest aquifers in the United States is buried under the state of Illinois.         Nineteen major wells tap the aquifer, providing a network of ground measurements of the water table.Those measurements—the sort hydrologists are used to—matched GRACE observations. Additional         measurements of groundwater in Oklahoma, California, and India provided even more validation.Over time, evidence and confidence mounted. As Rodell and Famiglietti published result after result, scientists         began to recognize the potential of GRACE data. “People eventually realized that if you’re         interested in measuring deep soil moisture or ground water from space,” Rodell says, “GRACE is the         only game in town.”Being able to see groundwater change is nice, but to make that measurement useful to decision makers, Wardlow         needed to put the measurement into context. Just how bad was the 2011 drought compared to others in the past         century? GRACE has only been in orbit since 2002, so how could Wardlow compare 2011 to droughts in the 1970s or         1950s?Brian Wardlow combines ground measurements with GRACE data to map soil moisture and ground water throughout             the United States. (Photograph courtesy University of Nebraska, Lincoln.)When challenged to provide that context, Rodell’s solution was a simulation of his land surface model based         on historical meteorological data from 1948 to the present. After ensuring that the introduction of GRACE data         into the model in 2002 did not cause any sudden shifts in the model’s depiction of reality, Rodell used         the six-decade simulation to compare with current conditions.“For each week, we look at the water storage in the current week versus our long-term record from the         model,” says Rodell. The comparison allows Rodell to rank drought conditions and to provide much needed         context. For instance, a severe drought might be ranked at two percent, meaning that since 1948, conditions were         drier just two percent of the time. After three years of developing and refining his method, Rodell started to         deliver GRACE products in 2011 to Wardlow.This method of presenting GRACE measurements as a percent of normal was just what the  needed. “It allows us to compare GRACE         groundwater with other drought indicators,” says Wardlow. “It helps the drought analysts converge on         a category of drought severity.” That decision is important because farmers, insurance companies, and         government officials use the assessment to determine the level of response to a drought.“On a practical level, there is some hesitancy and some skepticism to use the data sets,” admits         Wardlow. “The drought monitors like to look at things over a period of a year or two years to see if the         patterns make sense. So we’re still in that buy-in period.”But if GRACE has proven anything, it’s that it can overcome doubt.

        "content": "Viewed from space, one of the most striking features of our home planet is the water, in both liquid and frozen forms, that covers approximately 75% of the Earth’s surface. Geologic evidence suggests that large amounts of water have likely flowed on Earth for the past 3.8 billion years—most of its existence. Believed to have initially arrived on the surface through the emissions of ancient volcanoes, water is a vital substance that sets the Earth apart from the rest of the planets in our solar system. In particular, water appears to be a necessary ingredient for the development and nourishment of life.Earth is a water planet: three-quarters of the surface is covered by water, and water-rich clouds fill the sky. (NASA.)Water is practically everywhere on Earth. Moreover, it is the only known substance that can naturally exist as a gas, a liquid, and solid within the relatively small range of air temperatures and pressures found at the Earth’s surface.Water is the only common substance that can exist naturally as a gas, liquid, or solid at the relatively small range of temperatures and pressures found on the Earth’s surface. Sometimes, all three states are even present in the same time and place, such as this wintertime eruption of a geyser in Yellowstone National Park.  (Photograph ©2008 )In all, the Earth’s water content is about 1.39 billion cubic kilometers (331 million cubic miles), with the bulk of it, about 96.5%, being in the global oceans. As for the rest, approximately 1.7% is stored in the polar icecaps, glaciers, and permanent snow, and another 1.7% is stored in groundwater, lakes, rivers, streams, and soil. Only a thousandth of 1% of the water on Earth exists as water vapor in the atmosphere.Despite its small amount, this water vapor has a huge influence on the planet. Water vapor is a powerful  greenhouse gas, and it is a major driver of  the Earth’s weather and climate as it travels around the globe, transporting  with it. Latent heat is heat obtained by water molecules as they transition from liquid or solid to vapor; the heat is released when the molecules condense from vapor back to liquid or solid form, creating cloud droplets and various forms of precipitation.Water vapor—and with it energy—is carried around the globe by weather systems. This satellite image shows the distribution of water vapor over Africa and the Atlantic Ocean. White areas have high concentrations of water vapor, while dark regions are relatively dry. The brightest white areas are towering thunderclouds. The image was acquired on the morning of September 2, 2010 by SEVIRI aboard   METEOSAT-9. [Watch this  (23 MB QuickTime) of similar data to see the movement of water vapor over time.] (Image ©2010 )For human needs, the amount of freshwater on Earth—for drinking and agriculture—is particularly important. Freshwater exists in lakes, rivers, groundwater, and frozen as snow and ice. Estimates of groundwater are particularly difficult to make, and they vary widely. (The value in the above table is near the high end of the range.)Groundwater may constitute anywhere from approximately 22 to 30% of fresh water, with ice (including ice caps, glaciers, permanent snow, ground ice, and permafrost) accounting for  most of the remaining 78 to 70%.The water, or hydrologic, cycle describes the pilgrimage of water as water molecules make their way from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere and back again, in some cases to below the surface. This gigantic system, powered by energy from the Sun, is a continuous exchange of moisture between the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land.Earth’s water continuously moves through the atmosphere, into and out of the oceans, over the land surface, and underground.  ( courtesy NOAA National Weather Service )Studies have revealed that evaporation—the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas—from oceans, seas, and other bodies of water (lakes, rivers, streams) provides nearly 90% of the moisture in our atmosphere. Most of the remaining 10% found in the atmosphere is released by plants through transpiration. Plants take in water through their roots, then release it through small pores on the underside of their leaves. In addition, a very small portion of water vapor enters the atmosphere through sublimation, the process by which water changes directly from a solid (ice or snow) to a gas. The gradual shrinking of snow banks in cases when the temperature remains below freezing results from sublimation.Together, evaporation, transpiration, and sublimation, plus volcanic emissions, account for almost all the water vapor in the atmosphere that isn’t inserted through human activities. While evaporation from the oceans is the primary vehicle for driving the surface-to-atmosphere portion of the hydrologic cycle, transpiration is also significant. For example, a cornfield 1 acre in size can transpire as much as 4,000 gallons of water every day.After the water enters the lower atmosphere, rising air currents carry it upward, often high into the atmosphere, where the air is cooler. In the cool air, water vapor is more likely to condense from a gas to a liquid to form cloud droplets. Cloud droplets can grow and produce precipitation (including rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, and hail), which is the primary mechanism for transporting water from the atmosphere back to the Earth’s surface.When precipitation falls over the land surface, it follows various routes in its subsequent paths. Some of it evaporates, returning to the atmosphere; some seeps into the ground as soil moisture or groundwater; and some runs off into rivers and streams. Almost all of the water eventually flows into the oceans or other bodies of water, where the cycle continues. At different stages of the cycle, some of the water is intercepted by humans or other life forms for drinking, washing, irrigating, and a large variety of other uses.Groundwater is found in two broadly defined layers of the soil, the “zone of aeration,” where gaps in the soil are filled with both air and water, and, further down, the “zone of saturation,” where the gaps are completely filled with water. The boundary between these two zones is known as the  which rises or falls as the amount of groundwater changes.The amount of water in the atmosphere at any moment in time is only 12,900 cubic kilometers, a minute fraction of Earth’s total water supply: if it were to completely rain out, atmospheric moisture would cover the Earth’s surface to a depth of only 2.5 centimeters. However, far more water—in fact, some 495,000 cubic kilometers of it—are cycled through the atmosphere every year. It is as if the entire amount of water in the air were removed and replenished nearly 40 times a year.This map shows the distribution of water vapor throughout the depth of the atmosphere during August 2010. Even the wettest regions would form a layer of water only 60 millimeters deep if it were condensed at the surface. (NASA image by Robert Simmon, using  & AMSU data.)Water continually evaporates, condenses, and precipitates, and on a global basis, evaporation approximately equals precipitation. Because of this equality, the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere remains approximately the same over time. However, over the continents, precipitation routinely exceeds evaporation, and conversely, over the oceans, evaporation exceeds precipitation.In the case of the oceans, the continual excess of evaporation versus precipitation would eventually leave the oceans empty if they were not being replenished by additional means. Not only are they being replenished, largely through runoff from the land areas, but over the past 100 years, they have been replenished: sea level around the globe has risen approximately 17 centimeters over the course of the twentieth century.Sea level has been rising over the past century, partly due to thermal expansion of the ocean as it warms, and partly due to the melting of glaciers and ice caps. (Graph ©2010 )Sea level has risen both because of warming of the oceans, causing water to expand and increase in volume, and because more water has been entering the ocean than the amount leaving it through evaporation or other means. A primary cause for increased mass of water entering the ocean is the calving or melting of land ice (ice sheets and glaciers). Sea ice is already in the ocean, so increases or decreases in the annual amount of sea ice do not significantly affect sea level.Blackfoot (left) and Jackson (right) glaciers, both in the mountains of Glacier National Park, were joined along their margins in 1914, but have since retreated into separate alpine cirques. The melting of glacial ice is a major contributor to sea level rise. [ by E. B. Stebinger, Glacier National Park archives (1911), and Lisa McKeon, USGS (2009).]Throughout the hydrologic cycle, there are many paths that a water molecule might follow. Water at the bottom of Lake Superior may eventually rise into the atmosphere and fall as rain in Massachusetts. Runoff from the Massachusetts rain may drain into the Atlantic Ocean and circulate northeastward toward Iceland, destined to become part of a floe of sea ice, or, after evaporation to the atmosphere and precipitation as snow, part of a glacier.Water molecules can take an immense variety of routes and branching trails that lead them again and again through the three phases of ice, liquid water, and water vapor. For instance, the water molecules that once fell 100 years ago as rain on your great- grandparents’ farmhouse in Iowa might now be falling as snow on your driveway in California.Among the most serious Earth science and environmental policy issues confronting society are the potential changes in the Earth’s water cycle due to climate change. The science community now generally agrees that the Earth’s climate is undergoing changes in response to natural variability, including solar variability, and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Furthermore, agreement is widespread that these changes may profoundly affect atmospheric water vapor concentrations, clouds, precipitation patterns, and runoff and stream flow patterns.Global climate change will affect the water cycle, likely creating perennial droughts in some areas and frequent floods in others. ( ©2008 )For example, as the lower atmosphere becomes warmer, evaporation rates will increase, resulting in an increase in the amount of moisture circulating throughout the troposphere (lower atmosphere). An observed consequence of higher water vapor concentrations is the increased frequency of intense precipitation events, mainly over land areas. Furthermore, because of warmer temperatures, more precipitation is falling as rain rather than snow.One expected effect of climate change will be an increase in precipitation intensity: a larger proportion of rain will fall in a shorter amount of time than it has historically. Blue represents areas where climate models predict an increase in intensity by the end of the 21st century, brown represents a predicted decrease. (Map adapted from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.)In parts of the Northern Hemisphere, an earlier arrival of spring-like conditions is leading to earlier peaks in snowmelt and resulting river flows. As a consequence, seasons with the highest water demand, typically summer and fall, are being impacted by a reduced availability of fresh water.Changes in water runoff into rivers and streams are another expected consequence of climate change by the late 21st Century. This map shows predicted increases in runoff in blue, and decreases in brown and red. (Map by Robert Simmon, using  from Chris Milly, NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.)Warmer temperatures have led to increased drying of the land surface in some areas, with the effect of an increased incidence and severity of drought. The Palmer Drought Severity Index, which is a measure of soil moisture using precipitation measurements and rough estimates of changes in evaporation, has shown that from 1900 to 2002, the Sahel region of Africa has been experiencing harsher drought conditions. This same index also indicates an opposite trend in southern South America and the south central United States.Shifts in the water cycle occurred over the past century due to a combination of natural variations and human forcings. From 1900 to 2002, droughts worsened in Sub-Saharan and southern Africa, eastern Brazil, and Iran (brown). Over the same period western Russia, south-eastern South America, Scandinavia, and the southern United States had less severe droughts (green). (Map adapted from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.)While the brief scenarios described above represent a small portion of the observed changes in the water cycle, it should be noted that many uncertainties remain in the  of future climate. These uncertainties derive from  the sheer complexity of the climate system, insufficient and incomplete data sets, and inconsistent results given by current climate models. However, state of the art (but still incomplete and imperfect) climate models do consistently predict that precipitation will become more variable, with increased risks of drought and floods at different times and places.Orbiting satellites are now collecting data relevant to all aspects of the hydrologic cycle, including evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. NASA even has one satellite, Aqua, named specifically for the information it is collecting about the many components of the water cycle.Aqua launched on May 4, 2002, with six Earth-observing instruments:  the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES).NASA’s Aqua satellite carries a suite of instruments designed primarily to study the water cycle. (NASA image by Marit Jentoft-Nilsen.)Since water vapor is the Earth’s primary greenhouse gas, and it contributes significantly to uncertainties in projections of future global warming, it is critical to understand how it varies in the Earth system. In the first years of the Aqua mission, AIRS, AMSU, and HSB provided space-based measurements of atmospheric temperature and water vapor that were more accurate than any obtained before; the sensors also made measurements from more altitudes than any previous sensor. The HSB is no longer operational, but the AIRS/AMSU system continues to provide high-quality atmospheric temperature and water vapor measurements.Aqua’s AIRS and AMSU instruments measure relative humidity at multiple pressure levels, which correspond to altitude. Near the surface (100 kPa), the air above the ocean is almost saturated with water, while it is dry above Australia. It is generally drier higher in the atmosphere (60 kPa), except where convection lifts moisture aloft. At the lower edge of the stratosphere (10 kPa) the air is almost universally dry. (NASA maps by Robert Simmon, based on AIRS/AMSU data.)More recent studies using AIRS data have demonstrated that most of the warming caused by carbon dioxide does not come directly from carbon dioxide, but rather from increased water vapor and other factors that amplify the initial warming. Other  have shown improved estimation of the landfall of a hurricane in the Bay of Bengal by incorporating AIRS temperature measurements, and improved understanding of large-scale atmospheric patterns such as the In addition to their importance to our weather, clouds play a major role in regulating Earth’s climate system. MODIS, CERES, and AIRS all collect data relevant to the study of clouds. The cloud data include the height and area of clouds, the liquid water they contain, and the sizes of cloud droplets and ice particles. The size of cloud particles affects how they reflect and absorb incoming sunlight, and the reflectivity (albedo) of clouds plays a major role in High, thin cirrus clouds reflect relatively little sunlight back into space compared to the amount reflected by thick cumulus clouds. This map shows the reflectivity of cirrus clouds [with a maximum of 30 percent (shown in white)] during March of 2010. (Map by Robert Simmon, using  from the )One of the many variables AMSR-E monitors is global precipitation. The sensor measures microwave energy, some of which passes through clouds, and so the sensor can detect the rainfall even under the clouds.Water in the atmosphere is hardly the only focus of the Aqua mission. Among much else, AMSR-E and MODIS are being used to study sea ice. Sea ice is important to the Earth system not just as an important element in the habitat of polar bears, penguins, and some species of seals, but also because it can insulate the underlying liquid water against heat loss to the often frigid overlying polar atmosphere and because it reflects sunlight that would otherwise be available to warm the ocean.When it comes to sea ice, AMSR-E and MODIS provide complementary information. AMSR-E doesn’t record as much detail about ice features as MODIS does, but it can distinguish ice versus open water even when it is cloudy. The AMSR-E measurements continue, with improved resolution and accuracy, a satellite record of changes in the extent of polar ice that extends back to the 1970s.AMSR-E and MODIS also provide monitoring of snow coverage over land, another key indicator of climate change. As with sea ice, AMSR-E allows routine monitoring of the snow, irrespective of cloud cover, but with less spatial detail,  while MODIS sees  greater spatial detail, but only under cloud-free conditions.As for liquid water on land, AMSR-E provides information about soil moisture, which is crucial for vegetation including agricultural crops. AMSR-E’s monitoring of soil moisture globally permits, for example, the early identification of signs of drought.Aqua is the most comprehensive of NASA’s water cycle missions, but it isn’t alone. In fact, the Terra satellite also has MODIS and CERES instruments onboard, and several other spacecraft have made or are making unique water-cycle measurements.The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) was launched in January 2003, and it collected data  on the topography of the Earth’s ice sheets, clouds, vegetation, and the thickness of sea ice off and on until October 2009. A new ICESat mission, ICESat-2, is now under development and is scheduled to launch in 2015.ICESat’s precise observation of the surface elevation of Arctic sea ice enabled measurement of ice thickness. These images show that sea ice thinned from fall 2003 to fall 2008. Dark blue areas are thin ice, white areas are thick ice, gray regions are land, and light blue south of the ice pack represents open water. (NASA  by the NASA GSFC  using  data.)The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) is a unique mission that consists of two spacecraft orbiting one behind the other;  changes in the distance between the two provide information about the gravity field on the Earth below. Because gravity depends on mass, some of the changes in gravity over time signal a shift in water from one place on Earth to another. Through measurements of changing gravity fields, GRACE scientists are able to derive information about changes in the mass of ice sheets and glaciers and even changes in groundwater around the world.These GRACE data show monthly gravity differences calculated from a 2003-2007 baseline. The big contrasts in the Amazon are due to seasonal changes in rainfall. (NASA maps by Robert Simmon, using )CloudSat is advancing scientists’ understanding of cloud abundance, distribution, structure, and radiative properties (how they absorb and emit energy, including thermal infrared energy escaping from Earth’s surface). Since 2006, CloudSat has flown the first satellite-based, millimeter-wavelength cloud radar—an instrument that is 1000 times more sensitive than existing weather radars on the ground. Unlike ground-based weather radars that use centimeter wavelengths to detect raindrop-sized particles, CloudSat’s radar allows the detection of the much smaller particles of liquid water and ice in the large cloud masses that contribute significantly to our weather.CloudSat’s radar measures the vertical distribution of clouds, such as this profile of Hurricane Julia. (NASA image by Jesse Allen, based on  and  data.)The joint NASA and French Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) is providing new insight into the role that clouds and atmospheric aerosols (particles like dust and pollution) play in regulating Earth’s weather, climate, and air quality. CALIPSO combines an active laser instrument with passive infrared and visible imagers to probe the vertical structure and properties of thin clouds and aerosols over the globe.CloudSat (top) and CALIPSO (lower) are two satellites providing detailed views of the structure of clouds.

But as people have changed their everyday behaviors and patterns to contain or avoid the virus, there have been some subtle effects on the environment. There also has been misinformation. Below are four ways the virus is—and is not—affecting the environment in China.  On February 28,  how decreases in industrial, transportation, and business activity since the coronavirus outbreak had reduced levels of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO) over China. But researchers note that a measurable change in one pollutant does not necessarily mean air quality is suddenly healthy across the country. In February, news outlets reported unhealthy air pollution , which was largely affected by airborne particulate pollution known as . As reported in the , “weak winds, high humidity and a strong thermal inversion had trapped bad air in the city.”  NASA satellites  a high load of airborne aerosols. Measurements of  depict how the abundance of  in the air prevents light from traveling through the atmosphere to the ground.Beyond aerosol emissions, weather also plays an important role in determining air quality. NASA/USRA researcher  notes that wind patterns and the height of the planetary boundary layer — the lowest layer of the troposphere near Earth’s surface — are important meteorological factors.  influences how air pollution mixes vertically in the atmosphere. If the height of the boundary layer is high, then air pollutants can move higher into the atmosphere and concentrations will be lower near the ground (and vice versa). Liu and her colleagues are currently studying how changes in such meteorological factors may have influenced the decrease in NO before and during the quarantine.

And compared to late January 2019, domestic flights within mainland China this year  60 to 70 percent.A  stated that key industries in China were operating at much lower-than-normal levels during the quarantine. Oil refinery operations in Shandong province, for instance, were at their lowest since 2015. Average coal consumption at power plants also reached a four-year low. As a result, carbon dioxide (CO) emissions were at least 25 percent lower in the two weeks following the Lunar New Year compared to 2019. However, that decrease in CO emissions for two weeks would only reduce annual totals by approximately 1 percent.In February 2020, a  floating around on social media showed increased sulfur dioxide (SO) concentrations near Wuhan. Some news outlets prematurely speculated that the elevated levels of SO were due to an increase in human cremation. The data for the map came from NASA’s  and were not based on real-time observations of SO. NASA’s Arlindo da Silva explained that while the GEOS model assimilates many ground-based and satellite observations to constrain meteorological conditions such as winds, humidity, and temperature, it currently does not ingest any real-time observations of sulfur dioxide. In the model, the concentrations of SO are estimated from historical emissions sources that are transported around the globe by atmospheric circulation. Therefore, da Silva said, GEOS model simulations cannot account for variations in SO concentrations arising from a sudden change in human activity (like a quarantine). Essentially, the model output of enhanced SO was not completely reflecting reality in this case.Secondly, as the writers at , sulfur dioxide is commonly associated with burning coal — not burning human corpses.Since its launch on the web in April 1999, NASA Earth Observatory has published more than 15,500 image-driven stories about our planet.

On January 22, ash plumes again emanated from Taal—but, this time, not from an eruption (seen above). According to the  (PHIVOLCS), strong low-level winds lifted previously deposited ash lying around the volcano to heights of 5,800 meters (19,000 feet).  “Resuspension of volcanic ash is more likely at higher wind speeds, if the ash is dry and if ash particles are small,” said Simon Carn, volcanologist at Michigan Tech. “The ash deposits at Taal may have initially been quite wet, so the fact that ash resuspension is now occurring may indicate that the deposits have dried out.” The Philippines is currently in its dry season.This time it was resuspended ash, but officials are cautious about a potential eruption again. Since its initial eruption, Taal remains on a level 4 alert, with a hazardous eruption still possible. Data  that SO₂ emissions, one of the key parameters for monitoring active volcanoes, have been present, but low, since the initial eruption. Carn said this indicates magma is most likely intruding into the main portion of the volcano, but predicting whether the magma will ultimately erupt is challenging. If the volcano erupts again, it could look different than the early January event. During that “wet” eruption, water from the nearby crater lake covered the ash particles with water droplets. Wetter eruptions tend to produce finer ash particles. However, nearly all of the  is now gone. According to Carn, the lake could have vaporized from the heat of the emanating magma; some could have been physically ejected by the previous eruption; and some could have drained through fractures or fissures in the volcano. In the absence of water, this volcano could produce a “dry” eruption, which would make comparatively larger ash particles. When you look at Earth from above as often as we do, you become intimately familiar with the shapes and patterns that can emerge across the planet. Some are made by people and others by nature. Some are ephemeral and others more permanent. Today we took a light-hearted approach to the Image of the Day, explaining the science behind one such shape—what appears to be a . The image prompted us to look and see where other heart-shaped features have turned up. “Pho,” a cartoon character representing a photon of light from ICESat-2, illustrates how the science mission works. Watch the video . Credit: NASA/Goddard/Savannah College of Art and Design et al.The successful launch of a satellite is an exciting step for the scientists and engineers who have spent years dedicated to a mission. But there are still many more boxes to be checked, and anticipation builds as a satellite’s instruments are turned on and they produce what scientists call “first light” — the first time a satellite opens its “eyes” and delivers preliminary images or data.After the  of NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 () on September 15, 2018, “first light” was not a natural-color image of Earth like those that come from satellites such as Terra, Aqua, or Landsat. Rather, the satellite’s sole instrument—the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS)—acquired measurements of surface elevation. The laser fired for the first time on September 30, and returned its first height measurements from across the Antarctic ice sheet on October 3.This visualization of ICESat-2 data shows the first set of height measurements from the satellite as it orbited over the Antarctic ice sheet. Credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight CenterThis elevation measurement, acquired on October 3, shows the height of the Antarctic ice sheet along a path starting in East Antarctica, passing close to the South Pole, and ending in West Antarctica. As explained in a  about the measurement:“When scientists analyze the preliminary ICESat-2 data, they examine what is called a “photon cloud,” or a plot of each photon that ATLAS detects. Many of the points on a photon cloud are from background photons — natural sunlight reflected off Earth in the exact same wavelength as the laser photons. But with the help of computer programs that analyze the data, scientists can extract the signal from the noise and identify height of the ground below.”These charts show the first photon returns from the instrument’s six beams as the satellite orbited over Antarctica. The green lines represent the number of photons detected. The X axis indicates the amount of time it took the photons to get from the satellite to the ground and back again. Credit: Megan Bock/NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, the project manager for the ATLAS instrument, said in the NASA story:“We were all waiting with bated breath for the lasers to turn on and to see those first photons return. Seeing everything work together in concert is incredibly exciting. There are a lot of moving parts and this is the demonstration that it’s all working together.”Earlier this month, we showed a —a colorful, circular optical phenomenon caused by water droplets scattering light. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on the Terra and Aqua satellites can see only a cross section of the glory, making it appear in satellite imagery as two elongated bands parallel to the path of the satellite.To the Earth-bound observer, however, glories take on a circular shape. You might have seen one while on an aircraft. From this perspective, passengers on the side of the plane directly opposite the Sun can sometimes see the plane’s shadow on the clouds below. This position is also where glories can be observed as the cloud’s water droplets scatter sunlight back toward a source of light.Before aviation, the phenomenon was often seen by mountain climbers; the glory encircling the climber’s shadow on the clouds below. Today, pilots and passengers have a good chance of seeing them, earning the phenomenon the name “glory of the pilot” or “’s halo.”But you still have to be flying close enough to the cloud deck for the phenomenon to be visible, which is one of the reasons why they are frequently spotted by scientists and crew with NASA’s  mission. The mission makes annual flights over Earth’s poles to map the ice; flights are relatively low, long, and frequent. Glories are not part of the mission’s science goals—in fact, clouds can interfere with the collection of science data. But they are on the list of natural wonders that IceBridge scientists witness in the field.Jeremy Harbeck, a sea ice scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, snapped the top photograph of a glory on April 18, 2018, during an IceBridge science flight over the Chukchi Sea. (See the full image and other photographs shot by Harbeck during the Arctic 2018 IceBridge campaign .)“I remember having taken more images of glories, especially down over Antarctica, as we see them quite often down there,” Harbeck said. “From what I remember, they’re not outside the window all the time, but you can catch them here and there on flights when conditions are right.”One such Antarctic glory is visible in the image above, snapped by Michael Studinger during an IceBridge flight on October 26, 2010. Read more about that image .  Remember the year 2000? Bill Clinton was president of the United States, Faith Hill and Santana topped Billboard music charts, and the world’s computers had just “survived” the . It also was the year that NASA’s  began collecting images of Earth.Eighteen years later, the versatile satellite  with five scientific sensors  is still operating. For all of that time, the satellite’s  (MODIS) has been collecting daily data and imagery of the Arctic  and the rest of the planet, too.If you knew where to look and were willing to wait patiently for file downloads, the images have always been available on specialized websites used by scientists. But there was no quick-and-easy way for the public to browse the imagery. With the  of MODIS data into , checking on what was happening anywhere in the world on any day since 2000 has gotten much easier.Say you want to check on the weather in your hometown on the day you or your child was born. Just navigate to the date on Worldview, and make sure that the MODIS data layer is turned on. (In the image below, you can tell the Terra MODIS data layer is on because it is light gray.)One of the things I love about having all this MODIS data at my fingertips is that it makes it possible to see the passage of relatively long periods of time in just a few minutes. Look, for instance, at the animation at the top of this page, generated by Delft University of Technology ice scientist  using Worldview.Lhermitte summoned every natural-color MODIS image of the Arctic that Terra and Aqua (which also has a MODIS instrument) have collected since April 2003. The result  a product of 71,000 satellite overpasses  is a remarkable six-minute time capsule of swirling clouds, bursts of wildfire smoke, the comings and goings of snow, and the ebb and flow of sea ice.Though beautiful, Lhermitte’s animation also has a troubling side to it. If you look carefully, you can see the downward trend in sea ice extent. Look, for instance, at   the period when Arctic sea ice extent  of 3.4 million square miles. Between the heavy cloud cover, you will see lots of dark open water. Compare that to the same period in 2003, when the minimum extent was 6.2 million square miles.  Scientists attribute the  to .Earth Matters had a conversation with Lhermitte to find why he made the clip and what stands out about it. MODIS images of notable events that Lhermitte mentioned are interspersed throughout the interview. All of the images come from the archives of NASA Earth Observatory, a website that was  in conjunction with the launch of Terra. The extension of the MODIS record back to the beginning of the mission in the Worldview website triggered me to make the animation. As a remote sensing scientist, I often use Worldview to put things into context (e.g. for studying changes over ice sheets and glaciers). Previously, Worldview only had data until 2010. I think the strength of the video is that it contains so many of them, and it allows you to see them all in one video. The ones that are most striking to me are: It was simple. I just downloaded the MODIS quicklook data from the Worldview archive using an automated script. Afterwards, I slightly modified the images for visualization purposes (e.g. overlaying country borders, clipping to a circular area). and stitched everything together in a video. On the one hand, I am fascinated by the beauty and complexity of our planet. On the other hand, as a scientist, it makes me want to understand its processes even better. The video shows so many different processes at different scales, from natural processes (annual changes in snow cover and the Vatnajökull ash plume) to climate change related changes (e.g. the long term decrease in sea ice).Terra MODIS image of the eruption of Grímsvötn Volcano in Iceland on May 22, 2011.

I decided to leave all dates out where part of the Arctic is without sunlight during satellite overpasses (approximately 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. local time). The missing data due to the polar night are very prominent if you compile the complete record including winter months, and I did not want it to distract the viewer from the more subtle changes in the video.A Terra MODIS image of smoke and fires in Siberia on June 29, 2012.

Take, for instance, the image below, from our January 2017 article about . But saline lakes are an environment unto themselves.Lakes cover about  of the Earth’s land surface. Many of the largest ones (by area) are salty: Utah’s Great Salt Lake, the  (arguably the world’s biggest lake), Iran’s , and the Dead Sea. Unlike marine and brackish waters,  typically form inland, and do not connect to the ocean. They tend to be ephemeral, filling with water in periods of increased rainfall, and drying out under the Sun.In general, . Yet a number of invertebrates call saline lakes home. , for instance, have evolved to live in the salty, low-oxygen environment of the Great Salt Lake. The shrimp—also called “sea monkeys”—can survive even as water recedes. They are so plentiful, in fact, that fishermen corrale them using oil booms in an .Image: NASA Earth Observatory/Jeff Schmaltz Just how salty are these lakes? That depends on location and season. The Dead Sea has a salinity of 34 percent, while the Great Salt Lake varies between 10 and 30 percent; the same is true of Lake Urmia. (For comparison, open ocean waters average a 3.5 percent salt content.)Australia’s scorching hot weather and scant rainfall make it a hotbed for saline lakes—thousands of them. In her story on the  Down Under, my colleague Kathryn Hansen describes how they formed:The lakes below in Western Australia range from pea soup-brown to pinkish in hue. Their color changes based on sediments, aquatic and terrestrial plant growth, water chemistry, algae, and hydrology.Image: NASA Earth Observatory/Joshua StevensAt , the rise and fall of lake also has an effect on water color:While many salt lakes vary in size according to rainfall, some like Lake Urmia, have been shrinking in recent years.Image: NASA Earth Observatory/Joshua StevensHot, sunny days help create saline lakes by evaporating massive amounts of water, but salt lakes can also occur in cold climes. For instance,  sits in Antarctica’s McMurdo Valley, where winter temperatures can drop to -50 degrees Celsius (-58 degrees Fahrenheit). Don Juan is so salty that waters rarely freeze. Its extreme environment resembles that of Mars. While the lake is far too salty and cold for even salt-loving brine shrimp, it does house microorganisms, Brown University geologist, Jay Dickson, told the NASA Earth Observatory.“There is certainly biology in the vicinity of the pond and some evidence for biologic activity in the pond itself, but this activity could be explained by processes,” Dickson said. “Mars has a lot of salt and used to have a lot of water.”Image: NASA Earth Observatory/Jesse Allen "

        "content": "       Researchers are studying whether a wonder material used in Mars rovers could help warm parts of the Red Planet rich in water ice.     Raising crops on Mars is far easier in science fiction than it will be in real life: The Red Planet is an inhospitable world. Among other challenges, subzero temperatures mean water can persist on the surface only as ice, and the planet''s atmosphere offers little protection to plants (or people) from the Sun''s radiation.Of course, NASA has plans to eventually put humans on Mars, using lessons it will learn from its . And those humans will need to eat. Being able to produce food on Mars would help reduce the quantity of supplies consuming valuable space and fuel on crewed missions to the Red Planet. But figuring out how - and where - to produce that food, while also being exceedingly careful not to contaminate Mars with Earth-borne bacteria, are some of the challenges scientists and engineers face.In a new paper in Nature Astronomy, researchers propose that a material called aerogel might help humans one day build greenhouses and other habitats at Mars'' mid-latitudes, where near-surface water ice has been identified. The study was funded by Harvard University''s Faculty of Arts and Sciences.Aerogel is a Styrofoam-like solid that is 99% air, making it extremely light. It''s adept at preventing the transfer of heat as well, making it an excellent insulator; in fact, it''s been used for that purpose on all of NASA''s Mars rovers. Moreover, aerogel is translucent, allowing visible light to pass through while blocking ultraviolet light''s harmful radiation. Most aerogel is made from silica, the same material found in glass.In an experiment conducted by lead author Robin Wordsworth of Harvard, 2-3 centimeters of silica aerogel allowed light from a lamp tuned to simulate Martian sunlight to heat the surface beneath it by up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius) - enough to raise temperatures on the Martian surface and melt water ice.\"The study was meant as an initial test of aerogel''s potential as a Martian building material,\" said second author Laura Kerber, a geologist at NASA''s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Kerber participated in a 2015 NASA workshop to identify the best places on Mars to send astronauts. \"The ideal place for a Martian outpost would have plentiful water and moderate temperatures,\" she said. \"Mars is warmer around the equator, but most of the water ice is located at higher latitudes. Building with silica aerogel would allow us to artificially create warm environments where there is already water ice available.\"Broadening the regions on Mars where humans could grow things also opens up new areas where they could conduct valuable scientific research, Kerber added.The aerogel experiment was inspired by the heating process that creates so-called dark spots that dot Mars'' carbon dioxide ice caps during the spring. This kind of ice is better known on Earth as dry ice. Like aerogel, carbon dioxide ice is translucent, allowing sunlight to heat the surface below. As the soil warms, carbon dioxide gas accumulates between the ice and the warm surface, eventually causing the ice to rupture. That, in turn, creates a puff of gas that tosses soil beneath the ice onto its surface.The experiment explored a similar process with aerogel. The paper details how both a solid piece of aerogel as well as chunks of crushed aerogel can be used to heat the surface below. The researchers used varying levels of illumination produced by Martian seasons. The results suggest aerogel could even provide a heating effect in the bitter Martian winter. In the mid-latitudes, winter nighttime temperatures can be as cold as minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius).The next step, Wordsworth said, is taking the experiment out of the lab and into Martian analogues like Chile''s Atacama Desert or Antarctica''s McMurdo Dry Valleys. Like Mars, these environments reach subzero temperatures and are exceptionally dry.\"Our prediction is that aerogel shielding should provide more efficient heating as it scales in size,\" Wordsworth said. \"That would be important to see under field conditions.\"While the experiment was an encouraging proof of concept, Wordsworth acknowledged there are still significant engineering challenges to overcome. Based on a climate model produced along with the experiment, it would take lots of aerogel and at least two Mars years (or four Earth years) of warming to produce a permanent region of liquid water underneath. Although aerogel is several times lighter than air, building structures with roofs made out of the material would require shipping large quantities of it to Mars or somehow manufacturing it there.Silica aerogel is very fragile and porous; layering it within another translucent material, or combining it with flexible materials, could prevent fracturing. Doing so could increase air pressure under a structure made with an aerogel roof or shield as well, allowing liquid water to pool more easily on the surface instead of vaporizing in the thin Martian atmosphere.But the study''s authors noted that developing small habitability zones on Mars is more plausible than attempting to \"terraform\" the planet, as science-fiction writers have proposed doing in the past. A  last year dashed the hopes of thickening the Martian atmosphere enough to create an Earth-like greenhouse effect.\"Anything that would help make long-term habitability possible is exciting to consider,\" Wordsworth said.More information about NASA''s Mars program is at:Andrew GoodJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.818-393-2433Alana JohnsonNASA Headquarters, Washington202-672-4780 / 202-358-0668       2019-144            Mars              NASA’s Mars Fleet Lies Low With Sun Between Earth and Red Planet            Mars              NASA’s Perseverance Rover Cameras Capture Mars Like Never Before            Mars              NASA’s InSight Finds Three Big Marsquakes, Thanks to Solar-Panel Dusting            Technology              Solar Electric Propulsion Makes NASA’s Psyche Spacecraft Go            Mars              NASA’s Ingenuity Helicopter Captures a Mars Rock Feature in 3D            Mars              Take a 3D Spin on Mars and Track NASA’s Perseverance Rover            Mars              NASA Confirms Thousands of Massive, Ancient Volcanic Eruptions on Mars            Mars              Justin Simon Shepherds Perseverance Through First Phase of Martian Rock Sampling            Technology              Visionary Tech Concepts Could Pioneer the Future in Space            Mars              NASA’s Perseverance Rover Collects Puzzle Pieces of Mars’ History                Image                      Mars Sample Return Campaign Artist''s Concept                    Image                      Bright and Dark Slope Streaks                    Image                      A Colorful Landslide in Eos Chasma                    Image                      When Did the Light-Toned Layers Form?

        "content": "By Learn how, why, and what Perseverance will explore on Mars, plus find out about an exciting opportunity for you and your students to join in the adventure!On Feb. 18, NASA''s  touched down on the Red Planet after a seven-month flight from Earth. Only the fifth rover to land on the planet, Perseverance represents a giant leap forward in our scientific and technological capabilities for exploring Mars and the possibility that life may have once existed on the Red Planet.Here, you will:You might be wondering, \"Isn''t there already a rover on Mars?” The answer is yes! The  landed on Mars in 2012 and has spent its time on the Red Planet making fascinating discoveries about the planet''s geology and environment – setting the stage for Perseverance. So, why send another rover to Mars? The lessons we’ve learned from Curiosity coupled with advancements in technology over the last decade are allowing us to take the next big steps in our exploration of Mars, including looking for signs of ancient microbial life, collecting rock samples to bring to Earth one day, and setting the stage for a potential future human mission to the Red Planet.More specifically, the Perseverance Mars rover has four science objectives:With these science objectives in mind, let''s take a look at how the mission is designed to achieve these goals – from its science-rich landing site, , to its suite of onboard tools and technology. Lighter colors represent higher elevation in this image of Jezero Crater on Mars, the landing site for the Perseverance rover. The black oval indicates the area in which the rover will touch down, also called a landing ellipse. Image Credit: NASA JPL/Caltech/MSSS/JHU-APL/ESA | While present-day Mars is a cold, barren planet, science suggests that it was once very similar to Earth. The presence of clay, dried rivers and lakes, and minerals that formed in the presence of water provide extensive evidence that Mars once had flowing water at its surface. As a result, a mission looking for signs of ancient life, also known as biosignatures, should naturally follow that water. That’s because water represents the essential ingredient for life as we know it on Earth, and it can host a wide variety of organisms. This is what makes Perseverance''s landing site in Jezero Crater such a compelling location for scientific exploration. The crater was originally formed by an ancient meteorite impact about 3.8 billion years ago, and it sits within an even larger, older impact basin. The crater also appears to have once been home to an ancient lake fed by a river that formed the delta where Perseverance will begin its exploration, by exploring the foot of the river delta. Take a tour of Perseverance''s landing site in this animated flyover of the Martian surface. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech | Perseverance will begin its scientific exploration with the assistance of an array of tools, also known as science instruments. This artist''s concept shows the various science tools, or instruments, onboard the rover. Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech | Like its predecessor, Perseverance will have a number of  – 23, in fact!  – serving as the eyes of the rover for scientists and engineers back on Earth. Nine of these cameras are dedicated to mobility, or tracking the rover''s movements; six will capture images and videos as the rover travels through the Martian atmosphere down to the surface, a process known as entry, descent, and landing; and seven are part of the science instrumentation.SuperCam''s mast unit before being installed atop the Perseverance rover''s remote sensing mast.

Meanwhile, , also on the rover’s mast, can zoom in, focus, and take 3D color pictures and video at high speed to allow detailed examination of distant objects. A third camera, , fires a small laser burst to excite compounds on the surface and determine their composition using spectroscopy. Supercam is also equipped with a microphone. This microphone (one of two on the rover) will allow scientists to hear the pop the laser makes upon hitting its target, which may give scientists additional information about the hardness of the rock. Leaning more toward chemistry, the  (PIXL) will allow us to look at the composition of rocks and soil down to the size of a grain of salt. Elements respond to different types of light, such as X-rays, in predictable ways. So by shining an X-ray on Martian rocks and soil, we can identify elements that may be part of a biosignature.Meanwhile, a device called  will look for evidence of ancient life using a technique called Deep UV Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy can help scientists see the crystallinity and molecular structure of rocks and soil. For example, some molecules and crystals luminesce, or emit light, when exposed to ultraviolet – similar to how a blacklight might be used to illuminate evidence in a crime scene. Scientists have a good understanding of how chemicals considered key to life on Earth react to things like ultraviolet light. So, SHERLOC could help us identify those same chemicals on Mars. In other words, it can contribute to identifying those biosignatures we keep talking about.Rounding out its role as a roving geologist on wheels, Perseverance also has instruments for studying beneath the surface of Mars. An instrument called the  (RIMFAX) will use ground-penetrating radar to analyze depths down to about 100 feet (30 meters) below the surface. Mounted on the rear of the rover, RIMFAX will help us understand geological features that can''t be seen by the other cameras and instruments.The rover''s suite of instruments demonstrates how multiple scientific disciplines – chemistry, physics, biology, geology, and engineering – work in concert to further our understanding of Mars and help scientists uncover whether life ever existed on the Red Planet.At NASA, scientists and engineers are always looking to push the envelope and, while missions such as Perseverance are ambitious in themselves, they also provide an opportunity for NASA to test new technology that could be used for future missions. Two excellent examples of such technology joining Perseverance on Mars are  and the first ever Mars helicopter, . Members of Perseverance mission team install MOXIE into the belly of the rover in the cleanroom at NASA''s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech | MOXIE stands for the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment. Operating at 800 degrees Celsius, MOXIE takes in carbon dioxide (CO2) from the thin Martian atmosphere and splits those molecules into pure oxygen using what is called a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that allows for reactions to take place under conditions they normally wouldn’t. MOXIE provides an incredible opportunity for NASA to create something usable out of the limited resources available on Mars. Over the duration of the rover''s mission, MOXIE will run for a total of one hour every time it operates, distributed over the course of the prime mission timeframe, to determine whether it can reliably produce breathable oxygen. The goal of operating this way is to allow scientists to determine the performance across a variety of environmental conditions that a dedicated, human-mission-sized oxygen plant would see during operations - day versus night, winter versus summer, etc. Oxygen is of great interest for future missions not just because of its necessity for future human life support on Mars, but also because it can be used as a rocket propellant, perhaps allowing for future small-scale sample return missions to Earth.This artist''s concept shows Ingenuity, the first Mars helicopter, on the Red Planet''s surface with Perseverance (partially visible on the left) in the distance. Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech | The Mars Ingenuity helicopter is likewise an engineering first. It is a technology demonstration to test powered flight on Mars. Because the Martian atmosphere is so thin, flight is incredibly difficult. So, the four-pound (1.8-kilogram), solar powered helicopter is specially designed with two, four-foot (1.2-meter) long counter-rotating blades that spin at 2,400 rotations per minute. In the months after Perseverance lands, Ingenuity will drop from the belly of the rover. If all goes well, it will  attempt test flights of increasing difficulty, covering incrementally greater heights and distances for about 30 days. In the future, engineers hope flying robots can allow for a greater view of the surrounding terrain for robotic and human missions alike.

Glacial ice, rivers, and fierce winds have sculpted two spectacular lakes and several deltas in this part of Patagonia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Lena River branches out across broad, flat tundra in northeastern Siberia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Heliophysics and astrophysics research brings people to this small community in a rugged part of southwestern New Mexico.

A slow-moving wall of basaltic lava is bulldozing its way through communities on one of the Canary Islands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The proportion of the world’s population exposed to floods grew by 20 to 24 percent—ten times greater than what previous models had predicted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Shadows accentuate the depth of the canyon that the Niagara River has carved over the past 12,000 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            An astronaut photograph shows the proximity of a volcanic eruption to nearby cities on the Spanish island of La Palma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Net radiation is the balance between incoming and outgoing energy at the top of the atmosphere. It is the total energy available to influence climate after light and heat are reflected, absorbed, or emitted by clouds and land.                                                                                                                                  The KNP fire complex and Windy fire are threatening groves of giant sequoias and prompting authorities to issue evacuation orders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      When fuels such as coal, wood, and oil burn incompletely, they produce carbon monoxide. The gas is spread by winds and circulation. These maps show monthly averages of CO in the lower atmosphere.                                                                                                                                  One of the CubeSats launching with Landsat 9 is the Cusp Plasma Imaging Detector (CuPID), which will image the boundary where Earth’s magnetic field interacts with the Sun’s.                                                                                                                                  Water levels at Glen Canyon Dam have fallen to their lowest level since 1969 and are still dropping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Landsat satellites have enabled numerous applications in diverse fields, including the monitoring of global agriculture and food security applications.                                                                                                                                  Sea ice covered more area this summer compared to recent years, but it was also much thinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in a different part of the world? What would the weather be like? What kinds of animals would you see? Which plants live there? By investigating these questions, you are learning about biomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                       12 months of high-resolution global true color satellite imagery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Seasonal rains along the White Nile and Blue Nile can cause widespread devastation when the rivers overflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      50 Years. 9 million scenes.

These maps show the ‘metabolism” of Earth’s plants and trees. Net primary productivity is the difference between the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed during photosynthesis minus the amount released by respiration.                                                                                                                                                                                                       Summer is beach season in the northern hemisphere. But even if you''re a regular at your local swimming hole, you probably haven''t seen too many beaches from this perspective.

No sunblock necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                       In addition to making rain and snow, clouds can have a warming or cooling influence depending on their altitude, type, and when they form. These maps show what fraction of an area was cloudy each month.                                                                                                                                  What do you do when presented with a new satellite image? Here''s what the Earth Observatory team does to understand the view.                                                                                                                                  Clouds can be a nuisance when scientists are trying to observe features on Earth''s surface. But at other times, clouds are exactly what they want to see. These images highlight some of the more unusual and beautiful clouds observed in recent years from space.                                                                                                                                                                                                       Since 1999, Earth Observatory has published images and stories from all over our planet. Now you can explore more than 11,000 images in a different way: by location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            NASA has a unique vantage point for observing the beauty and wonder of Earth and for making sense of it. The images in this book tell a story of a 4.5-billion-year-old planet where there is always something new to see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Whether started by humans (farming, logging, or accidents) or by nature (lightning), fires are always burning somewhere on Earth. These maps show the locations of fires burning around the world each month.                                                                                                                                  Satellite images of Earth at night have been a curiosity for the public and a tool of fundamental research for at least 25 years. They have provided a broad, beautiful picture, showing how humans have shaped the planet and lit up the darkness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For 20 years, astronauts have been shooting photos of Earth from the space station. Like everything the astronauts do, they are trained for this job. And like everything they do, there is purpose and intention behind it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            These maps depict how much hotter or cooler an ocean basin was compared to the long-term average.

        "content": "Five decades ago, NASA and the U.S. Geological Society launched a satellite to monitor Earth’s landmasses. The Apollo era had given us our first look at Earth from space and inspired scientists to regularly collect images of our planet. The first Landsat — originally known as the  (ERTS) — rocketed into space in 1972. Today we are preparing to launch the ninth satellite in the series. Each Landsat has improved our view of Earth, while providing a continuous record of how our home has evolved. We decided to examine the legacy of the Landsat program in a four-part series of videos narrated by actor Marc Evan Jackson (who played a Landsat scientist in the movie ). The series moves from the birth of the program to preparations for launching Landsat 9 and even into the future of these satellites. The soon-to-be-launched  is the intellectual and technical successor to eight generations of Landsat missions. Episode 1 answers the “why?” questions. Why did space exploration between 1962 and 1972 lead to such a mission? Why did the leadership of several U.S. government agencies commit to it? Why did scientists come to see satellites as important to advancing earth science? In this episode, we are introduced to William Pecora and Stewart Udall, two men who propelled the project forward, as well as Virginia Norwood, who breathed life into new technology. The early Landsat satellites carried a sensor that could “see” visible light, plus a little bit of near-infrared light. Newer Landsats, including the coming Landsat 9 mission, have two sensors: the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). Together they observe in visible, near-infrared, shortwave-infrared, and thermal infrared wavelengths. By comparing observations of different wavelengths, scientists can identify algal blooms, storm damage, fire burn scars, the health of plants, and more.Episode 2 takes us inside the spacecraft, showing how Landsat instruments collect carefully calibrated data. We are introduced to Matt Bromley, who studies water usage in the western United States, as well as Phil Dabney and Melody Djam, who have worked on designing and building Landsat 9. Together, they are making sure that Landsat continues to deliver data to help manage Earth’s precious resources. The Landsat legacy includes five decades of observations, one of the longest continuous Earth data records in existence. The length of that record is crucial for studying change over time, from the growth of cities to the extension of irrigation in the desert, from insect damage to forests to plant regrowth after a volcanic eruption. Since 2008, that data has been free to the public. Anyone can download and use Landsat imagery for everything from scientific papers to crop maps to beautiful art. Episode 3 explores the efforts of USGS to downlink and archive five . We introduce Mike O’Brien, who is on the receiving end of daily satellite downloads, as well as Kristi Kline, who works to make Landsat data available to users. Jeff Masek, the Landsat 9 project scientist at NASA, describes how free access to data has revolutionized what we are learning about our home planet. For the past 50 years, Landsat satellites have shown us Earth in unprecedented ways, but they haven’t operated in isolation. Landsat works in conjunction with other satellites from NASA, NOAA, and the European Space Agency, as well as private companies. It takes a combination of datasets to get a full picture of what’s happening on the surface of Earth. In Episode 4, we are introduced to Danielle Rappaport, who combines audio recordings with Landsat data to measure biodiversity in rainforests. Jeff Masek also describes using Landsat and other data to understand depleted groundwater. Learn more about the  at NASA.

The kiwi is more difficult to find somewhere below the map where grids can be connected To the centre page.Using green color I found then it is next the triangle where there are lots Of other activities such as logging and farming plus artillery and small gun fires. I am then asked to conclude the Landsat studies of there are three proportions ,the first Was the blue line from north to south,in the USA the color is white. The latency some of which is next to the coast and the proportion changes to the land mass with Data 1017 next to the gulf. Finally there is the arctic as it paints the top of the map all white. The look for water shows that water is a scarcity.A project from the price of water as a commodity will Show really what is happening in real time.If the timeframe is set from 2011 and projection to 2030 The starting point is 500 and the end point is projected to be 2000. What happens in shanghai was the speed of urbanisation changing the river landscape and consuming More water as refllected on the right to left side of the screen. The oli is to bring the sweep into a central,structured database to improve the timing of the camera shots And it’s accessibility.The program asks just one question?Is it suitable for life? Geolocation data from gps systems was made available so that the total square kilometres could be Measured against metadata collected from the gulf to prove that there is global warming. The south therefore has higher temperatures than the north because it is hot. NASA world tournament competition is really cool!      "

Using instruments on NASA''s 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft, surprised scientists have found enormous quantities of buried treasure lying just under the surface of Mars -- enough water ice to fill Lake Michigan twice over. And that may just be the tip of the iceberg.       \"This is really amazing. This is the best direct evidence we have of subsurface water ice on Mars. We were hopeful that we could find evidence of ice, but what we have found is much more ice than we ever expected,\" said Dr. William Boynton, principal investigator for Odyssey''s gamma ray spectrometer suite at the University of Arizona, Tucson.       Scientists used Odyssey''s gamma ray spectrometer instrument suite to detect hydrogen, which indicated the presence of water ice in the upper meter (three feet) of soil in a large region surrounding the planet''s south pole. \"It may be better to characterize this layer as dirty ice rather than as dirt containing ice,\" added Boynton. The detection of hydrogen is based both on the intensity of gamma rays emitted by hydrogen, and by the intensity of neutrons that are affected by hydrogen. The spacecraft''s high-energy neutron detector and the neutron spectrometer observed the neutron intensity.       The amount of hydrogen detected indicates 20 to 50 percent ice by mass in the lower layer. Because rock has a greater density than ice, this amount is more than 50 percent water ice by volume. This means that if one heated a full bucket of this ice-rich polar soil it would result in more than half a bucket of water.       The gamma ray spectrometer suite is unique in that it senses the composition below the surface to a depth as great as one meter. By combining the different type of data from the instrument, the team has concluded the hydrogen is not distributed uniformly over the upper meter but is much more concentrated in a lower layer beneath the top-most surface.       The team also found that the hydrogen-rich regions are located in areas that are known to be very cold and where ice should be stable. This relationship between high hydrogen content with regions of predicted ice stability led the team to conclude that the hydrogen is, in fact, in the form of ice. The ice-rich layer is about 60 centimeters (two feet) beneath the surface at 60 degrees south latitude, and gets to within about 30 centimeters (one foot) of the surface at 75 degrees south latitude.       \"Mars has surprised us again. The early results from the gamma ray spectrometer team are better than we ever expected,\" said Dr. R. Stephen Saunders, Odyssey''s project scientist at NASA''s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"In a few months, as we get into martian summer in the northern hemisphere, it will be exciting to see what lies beneath the cover of carbon dioxide dry-ice as it disappears.\"       \"The signature of buried hydrogen seen in the south polar area is also seen in the north, but not in the areas close to the pole. This is because the seasonal carbon dioxide (dry ice) frost covers the polar areas in winter. As northern spring approaches, the latest neutron data indicate that the frost is receding, revealing hydrogen-rich soil below,\" said Dr. William Feldman, principal investigator for the neutron spectrometer at Los Alamos National Laboratories, New Mexico.       \"We have suspected for some time that Mars once had large amounts of water near the surface. The big questions we are trying to answer are, ''where did all that water go?'' and ''what are the implications for life?'' Measuring and mapping the icy soils in the polar regions of Mars, as the Odyssey team has done, is an important piece of this puzzle, but we need to continue searching, perhaps much deeper underground, for what happened to the rest of the water we think Mars once had,\" said Dr. Jim Garvin, Mars Program Scientist, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.       Another new result from the neutron data is that large areas of Mars at low to middle latitudes contain slightly enhanced amounts of hydrogen, equivalent to several percent water by mass. Interpretation of this finding is ongoing, but the team''s preliminary hypothesis is that this relatively small amount of hydrogen is more likely to be chemically bound to the minerals in the soil, than to be in the form of water ice.       JPL manages the 2001 Mars Odyssey mission for NASA''s Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C. Investigators at Arizona State University, Tempe; the University of Arizona, Tucson; and NASA''s Johnson Space Center, Houston, operate the science instruments. The gamma-ray spectrometer was provided by the University of Arizona in collaboration with the Russian Aviation and Space Agency, which provided the high-energy neutron detector, and the Los Alamos National Laboratories which provided the neutron spectrometer. Lockheed Martin Astronautics, Denver, developed and built the orbiter. Mission operations are conducted jointly from Lockheed Martin and from JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

        "content": "    Note:  The functional description of each of the four major ECS sections is supported by a functional flow diagram, which, to reduce complexity, does not contain electrical circuitry.              When the vehicle is staged, the descent interstage water-feed line is severed by the interstage umbilical guillotine, and water is supplied from the ascent stage water tanks. Water quantity is monitored on either ascent water tank as required by switching. The water quantity caution light goes on when a less-than-full condition exists in either tank or when the tank water levels are unequal. Water from ascent stage water tank No. 1 is fed to the PLSS water disconnect through the ascent water valve for drinking, food preparation, PLSS fill, and fire extinguishing.  Water from the three water tanks enters the water tank selector valve ( ), which consists of two water-diverting spools. Setting the valve to the DESCENT or ASCENT position determines which tank is on-line.  When using the descent tank, water is supplied to the primary manifold (which consists of the primary pressure regulators and the primary evaporator f low No. 2 valve) by setting the water tank select valve to DESCENT. The water f lows through the series primary pressure regulators, which control water discharge pressure, in response to suit circuit gas reference pressure, at 0.5 to 1.0 psi above this gas pressure. With the primary evaporator flow valve ( ) opened, the water is routed to the primary sublimator. Discharge water from the water separator is routed through the secondary spool of the selector valve and joins the water from the primary pressure regulators. Setting the selector valve ( ) to ASC routes water from the ascent tanks through the primary pressure regulators and, with the primary evaporator flow No. 1 valve ( ) opened, to the primary sublimator. Water flow from the water separators is not changed by selection of the ASC position. If the primary pressure regulators fail, an alternative path to the primary sublimator is provided with the primary evaporator flow No. 2 valve ( ) opened. Water then flows directly from the ascent water tanks through the secondary pressure regulator and the primary evaporator flow No. 2 valve ( ) to the primary sublimator.  Under emergency conditions (failure of the primary HTS loop), water from the ascent tanks is directed through the secondary manifold (secondary pressure regulator) to the secondary sublimator and the suit circuit sublirnator by opening the secondary evaporator flow valve. Discharge water from the water separators is also directed to the sublimator.     "

        "content": "Maybe you have heard people call Earth   The nickname is well-deserved. As this mosaic of images from the  (MODIS) on the  satellite conveys so well, the majority of Earth’s surface is covered by either liquid or frozen water.  The atmosphere is awash with water as well. One satellite-based data set estimates that about  of Earth’s surface is covered by clouds (composed of water and ice droplets) at any given time.Earth is home to yet another type of water—groundwater—which includes all the fresh water stored underground in soil and porous rock aquifers. Though groundwater is often forgotten because it’s not visible, more than two billion people rely on it as their primary water source.With drought afflicting several parts of the world, and with aggressive use of groundwater in many agricultural regions, this precious water resource is under serious strain, warns NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory hydrologist  In a  published by in October 2014, Famiglietti wrote:Image by J.T. Reager, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Most of the major aquifers in the world’s arid and semi-arid zones—the parts of the world that rely most heavily on groundwater—are experiencing rapid rates of depletion because of water use by farms. As shown in the chart above—based on data collected by the  (GRACE)—this includes include the North China Plain, Australia’s Canning Basin, the Northwest Sahara Aquifer System, the Guarani Aquifer in South America, the High Plains and Central Valley aquifers of the United States, and the aquifers beneath northwestern India and the Middle East.The situation is looking particularly grim in California, a state currently suffering from extreme drought. The extent of the drought is visible in the series of GRACE maps of dry season (September-November) water storage anomalies shown below. Red areas show the height of the water in comparison to a 2005-2010 average. California’s Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins have lost roughly 15 cubic kilometers (4 cubic miles) of total water per year since 2011 — more water than all 38 million Californians use for domestic and municipal supplies annually. Over half of the water losses are due to groundwater pumping in the Central Valley, according to Famiglietti.Image by Felix Landerer, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.The first step to managing the globe’s groundwater problem is to accept that we have one, Famiglietti recommends. And when societies are ready to look for solutions, the first place they’ll have to turn is the agricultural sector. “Agriculture accounts for nearly 80 percent of water use globally, and at least half of the irrigation water used is groundwater,” he wrote. “Even modest gains in agricultural efficiency will result in tremendous volumes of groundwater saved, or of water available for the environment or other human uses such as municipalities, energy production, industry and economic growth.”Read the   You can read news reports about Famiglietti’s article from  the  and  Read more about observing groundwater from space in  Watch Famiglietti give a TEDx talk about groundwater losses below.                                                                               Houston – “We have a problem”…….. Please send  me  ppt I believe there is another source of depletion impacting our ground water.  While I have no scientific data to support this, logically over time this will have an impact.   I am referring to the thousands or more, of partially empty plastic bottles of water that are thrown away daily.  People give no thought to tossing these bottles in the thrash without first emptying the contents, trapping the contents for years in the plastic bottles.  Without data to support this, it may seem insignificant.  I would argue that when you multiply the thousands of times a day this occurs, it will eventually have a negative impact. My suggestion is to invest in an awareness campaign similar to recycling.  If people are aware they will change their habits, take the two seconds it takes to empty the bottle before they throw it in the trash, trapping that water for however many years takes that plastic bottle to deteriorate. You don’t land $1.3 billion on a comet unless it’s for the purpose of mining comets in the future for water. SpaceX, and Ad Astra are the next big IPOs. ORB will be acquired by SpaceX. Believe it or Not – the Solar Flares from the Sun cause vaporization of the entire Earth’s water particularly with larger and more ozone holes around us.  Just as happened on MARS it is happening on our planet. Cloud seeding and tampering with the weather has caused an imbalance and we are all at risk now as a result of it.  The first indication is extinction of many insect and animal species then we will be next. Just look at the satellite photos of the changes happening both above us, the surface and within our planet.  Also you cannot get away with continual extraction of oil which eventually will result in shrivelling and cracking even splitting the planet apart.  All the money in the world will not help any of us then and all the wars going on.  We are in serious trouble and most of the people do not even realize it yet. We’re starting to bump up against the limits imposed by the laws of thermodynamics.  Here, the law of conservation of mass/energy: matter/energy cannot be created or destroyed – only its form can be changed.  For most of recent history, there’s always been another energy source to exploit, or more untapped resources.  Our societies are like trust fund kids, who keep spending capital because there’s so much, it cannot be exhausted… until, one day, the money’s gone.There’s only so much water on the planet – no matter what technical wizardry is invented for making it drinkable, sooner or later, all the water will be in use.  What then? Mucho he pensado en esto, y he escrito las posibles causas, y leyendo el comunicado 14-280 del 9 de octubre sobre “punto caliente de metano en eeuu”, creo que una de las causas de la desaparicion de las aguas en el Oeste es debido al fracking, un proceso que consume mucha agua. wut about the government …we as people kno we cannot survive without water..we also kno the end is near..there is the space station..which is our species next…( world )..so i wonder how much of our water is being sent there?

Participants with the most observations will receive a personalized thank you from a NASA scientist.“What excites researchers about GLOBE observations is the ability to see what’s up in the sky from volunteers’ perspectives all over the world,” said Marilé Colón Robles, lead for the GLOBE Clouds Team at NASA’s Langley Research Center. “What our eyes can see is difficult to fully duplicate with instruments. Merging these views is what makes a complete and impactful story.”“We want to do a data challenge in the fall and see if there are any differences from what was observed during the spring data challenge of 2018,” said Colón Robles. “From thin, high clouds that are hard for satellites to detect to dust storms that impact our daily lives, these observations play an important role in better understanding our atmosphere.” At NASA, scientists work with a suite of satellite instruments known as the . Though they have these highly sensitive instruments, it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to distinguish features such as cirrus clouds from snow cover in their imagery because both are cold and bright from a satellite perspective. By comparing satellite images from a particular area with data submitted by citizen scientists, researchers can differentiate between the two.Lucky GLOBE observers might make an observation while the  is overhead. CALIPSO is a joint mission between NASA and the French space agency (CNES) that uses laser pulses to measure clouds and atmospheric aerosols. Citizen scientists who make observations at the same time and place as CALIPSO will receive an emailed satellite comparison of CALIPSO’s measurements showing features such as high clouds, dust, and smoke. Scientists are especially interested in these observations in order to improve their understanding of dust storms. During the challenge, make sure you turn on daily satellite notifications in the app or use this  to see the schedule for your location.“Last year’s challenge gave researchers special glimpses into cloud types around the world,” said Colón Robles. “Photographs provided by observers gave insight into events such as dust storms and wildfires. Our hope is to once again learn from the community and together study our atmosphere.”The 2018 data challenge, which took place in the spring, received more than 56,000 cloud observations from more than 15,000 locations in 99 countries  and Antarctica. The UK’s Antarctic Place-names Committee has agreed that seven ice features in western Antarctica should be named for Earth-observation satellites. One of them is Landsat Ice Steam. The new designations were announced on June 7, 2019. The ice features are all located in Western Palmer Land on the .The seven features ring George VI Sound like pearls on a necklace. The new names, as officially entered into the British Antarctic Territory Gazetteer, are (from west to east): Landsat Ice Steam, ALOS Ice Rumples, Sentinel Ice Stream,  Ice Stream, Envisat Ice Stream, Cryosat Ice Stream, and ERS Ice Stream.The UK has submitted the new names for the fast-moving ice features to Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), which maintains a gazetteer or registry, of names officially adopted by individual nations. Under the Antarctic Treaty, signatory nations confer on geographic feature names, but each nation’s naming authority formally adopts new names. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names will meet in July and may discuss at that meeting whether the names adopted by the UK also will be adopted by the US. The question of using the term “glacier” for the ice features instead of “ice stream” is also part of each nation’s naming decision.The new names were proposed by Anna Hogg, a glaciologist with the Center for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds. In , Hogg found that glaciers draining from the  were accelerating, thinning, and retreating, with implications for global sea level rise. The fast-moving glaciers that Hogg and colleagues tracked with radar and optical satellite imagery were unnamed. In her paper, the glaciers had to be designated by latitude and longitude.Satellites had enabled Hogg and her team to clock the speed of these nameless ice features—some with rates faster than 1.5 meters/day. In tribute to the spaceborne instruments, Hogg came up with a way to describe the fast-moving ice features more succinctly—name them after the satellites that had helped her understand their behavior.Hogg proposed to the U.K.’s Antarctic Place-names Committee that the features should be named for Landsat, Sentinel, ALOS PALSAR, ERS, GRACE, CryoSat, and Envisat. She was notified in early June that the committee had agreed to adopt the names, which provide a way to recognize international collaboration, as fifteen space agencies currently collaborate on Antarctic data collection.“Satellites are the heroes in my science of glaciology,” Hogg . “They’ve totally revolutionized our understanding, and I thought it would be brilliant to commemorate them in this way.” Naming the glaciers after satellites is also a celebration of data fusion. “Our understanding of ice velocities and ice sheet mass balance has come from putting many different remote sensing data sets together—optical, radar, gravity, and laser altimetry,” said Jeff Masek, the NASA Landsat 9 Project Scientist. “Landsat has been a key piece in . Naming an ice stream after Landsat is a fitting way to recognize the value of long-term Earth Observation data for measuring changes in Earth’ polar regions.” from NASA’s Landsat science and outreach team, including the history of Antarctic observation with Landsat.  about all of the glaciers and their namesake satellites, as told by the European Space Agency.

They greatly expanded our knowledge of the country’s geography and biological diversity through their specimen collection, mapping of the landscape, and detailed journal entries.This year NASA and the National Park Service are encouraging the public to follow in the footsteps of Lewis and Clark through a new citizen science challenge. From June 1 to September 2, citizens are invited to use their smart phones and the NASA GLOBE Observer app to map land cover along the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail to assist scientists studying environmental changes.Land cover–such as grass, pavement, or trees–influences the  and  and influences a community’s vulnerability to natural disasters. NASA studies land cover changes from space as part of its mission to better understand our planet and improve lives.To participate in the “GO on a Trail” challenge, download the free  app from the Apple App Store or Google Play. Use the Land Cover tool to make observations of the landscape. Any observation made along the 5,000-mile-long Lewis & Clark trail from Pittsburgh to the mouth of the Columbia River . The top participants will receive recognition and GO on a Trail commemorative material.A good place to get started is at an observation station marked with a large sticker (image above) at Lewis and Clark visitor centers and museums. To navigate to sites of interest along the trail, the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail and GLOBE Observer teams have provided an .“We hope that by becoming involved with this project, people will care about the trail and become its stewards,” said Dan Wiley, chief of integrated resource stewardship for the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. Wiley notes that the challenge will both spark a general interest in science and show the public how it can be involved in collecting vital information for decision makers.GLOBE Observer is an app-based citizen science program active in more than 120 countries. The program invites citizens to contribute land cover, cloud, mosquito, and tree height observations to NASA and the science community. NASA-funded scientists are eager to see citizen science observations of land cover along this trail because of its wide range of ecological regions. Data collected during the challenge could help improve satellite-based mapping of land cover across the continent. “We are observing and monitoring our changing home planet from space to better understand how it is changing and what are the main drivers of change,” said Eric Brown de Colstoun, a scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. “The view from the ground provided by the challenge participants is one component that helps us verify the space-based data.”Even if you are not able to visit the Lewis and Clark Trail this summer, you can still join the GO on a Trail challenge from any of the more than 120 countries where GLOBE Observer is active. Just get outdoors and map the land cover around you. The top participants from beyond the trail will also receive recognition and commemorative material.“Lewis and Clark and their team were exploring a totally new environment to them,” said Brown de Colstoun. “We invite you to get out and explore, and document the places you know and care about. Go on a trail and do science along with us.”NASA GLOBE Observer and Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail will provide regular updates about the GO on a Trail challenge via social media throughout the summer with the hashtag #GOonaTrail.

Some observations originate from sensors in space; others can happen with a mobile phone in the palm of your hand.  is a free  that connects an international network of citizen scientists with the broader scientific community in an effort to document and analyze changes taking place in Earth’s air, land, water, and life. The app is the centerpiece of a citizen science blitz now underway.Both globalization and a changing climate have caused countless living creatures to adjust their range and distribution. For human health, one of the most concerning impacts of a changing climate is the range expansion of mosquitoes. These flying vectors of disease are responsible for illness in millions of people; they also cause more than 700,000 deaths each year. The northern hemisphere is now greening up in response to changes in sunlight and temperatures, and mosquito season is either just beginning or underway in much of the contiguous United States. The map above indicates when the first appearance of mosquitoes can be expected based on past weather data. The actual time of first appearance in a region can vary by several weeks, depending on the weather and other variables. The GLOBE Observer app has a new tool known as the Mosquito Habitat Mapper, which makes it possible for citizen scientists to observe, record, and share data about mosquito breeding sites using a mobile phone. The data are important to scientists trying to predict disease outbreaks and epidemics. Observations provided by citizen scientists, combined with satellite observations and models, can make it possible to track the range and spread of invasive mosquitoes.With the Mosquito Habitat Mapper, citizen scientists can report active and potential breeding sites in their communities. And using a built-in taxonomic key, GLOBE Observers can help determine whether the mosquito larvae have the potential to transmit disease pathogens to humans. GLOBE Observers also can have an immediate impact on health in their community.  In the last step of Mosquito Habitat Mapper, users report whether they were able to remove a breeding site. This can be accomplished in most cases by simply tipping and tossing standing water that is found in containers, or by covering stored water with a net or a lid. For larger water bodies such as ponds, irrigation ditches, or swamps, the reports about breeding sites can be used by mosquito surveillance agencies. In this way, GLOBE Observers are not only engaged scientifically, they can become agents of change in their community. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies source reduction–the elimination of mosquito breeding sites–as the most effective way to protect human populations and .

The satellite, the  (GPM) Core Observatory, paints a picture of global precipitation every 30 minutes, with help from its other international satellite partners. It has provided innumerable insights into Earth’s precipitation patterns, severe storms, and into the rain and snow particles within clouds. It has also helped farmers trying to increase crop yields, and aided researchers predicting the spread of fires.In honor of GPM’s fifth anniversary, we’re highlighting some of our favorite and most unique Earth Observatory stories, as made possible by measurements taken by GPM. In Fall 2018, storm after storm rolled through and dumped record rainfall in parts of Texas. When Hurricane Willa hit Texas around October 24, the ground was already soaked. One particularly potent cold front in mid-October dropped more than a foot of rain in areas. By the end of the month, October 2018 was the second wettest month in Texas on record. GPM measured the total amount of rainfall over the region from October 1 to October 31, 2018. The brightest areas reflect the highest rainfall amounts, with many places receiving 25 to 45 centimeters (10 to 17 inches) or more during this period. The satellite imagery can also be seen from .With the GPM mission’s global vantage point, we can more clearly see how weather systems form and connect with one another.  from October 11-22, 2017, note the long, narrow bands of moisture in the air, known as “atmospheric rivers.” These streams are fairly common in the Pacific Northwest and frequently bring much of the region’s heavy rains and snow in the fall and winter. But this atmospheric river was unusual for its length—extending roughly 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) from Japan to Washington. That’s about two to three times the typical length of an atmospheric river. Since atmospheric rivers often bring strong winds, they can force moisture up and over mountain ranges and drop a lot of precipitation in the process. In this case, more than  fell on the western slopes of the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range, while areas to the east of the mountains (in the ) generally saw less than one inch.Knowing how much precipitation is falling or has fallen is useful for people around the world. Farmers, in particular, are interested in knowing precipitation amounts so they can prevent overwatering or underwatering their crops. The  (SASWE) research group at the University of Washington has been working with the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) to bring this kind of valuable information  A survey by the PCRWR found that farmers who used the text message alerts reported a 40 percent savings in water. Anecdotally, many farmers say their income has doubled because they got more crops by applying the correct amount of water.The map above shows the forecast for evapotranspiration for October 16-22, 2018. Evapotranspiration is an indication of the amount of water vapor being removed by sunlight and wind from the soil and from plant leaves. It is calculated from data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, as well as a global numerical weather model that assimilates NASA satellite data. The team also looks at maps of precipitation, temperature and wind speed to help determine crop conditions. Precipitation data comes from GPM that is combined with ground-based measurements from the Pakistan Meteorological Department.Precipitation can drastically affect the spread of a fire. For instance, if a region has not received normal precipitation for weeks or months, the vegetation might be drier and more prone to catching fire. NASA researchers recently  that analyzes various weather factors that lead to the formation and spread of fires. The Global Fire Weather Database (GFWED) accounts for local winds, temperatures, and humidity, while also being the first fire prediction model to include satellite–based precipitation measurements. The animation above shows ’s calculated fire danger around the world from 2015 to 2017. The model compiles and analyzes various data sets and produces a rating that indicates how likely and intense fire might become in a particular area. It is the same type of rating that many firefighting agencies use in their day–to–day operations. Historical data are available to understand the weather conditions under which fires have occurred in the past, and near–real–time data are available to gauge current fire danger.In this mountainous country of Nepal, 60 to 80 percent of the annual precipitation falls during the monsoon (roughly June to August). That’s also when roughly 90 percent of Nepal’s landslide fatalities occur. NASA researchers have  to identify potential landslides that might otherwise go undetected and unreported. This information could significantly improve landslide inventories, leading to better risk management. The computer program works by scanning satellite imagery for signs that a landslide may have occurred recently, looking at topographical features such as hill slopes. The left and middle images above were acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite on September 15, 2013, and September 18, 2014—before and after the  on August 2, 2014. The image on the right shows that 2014 Landsat image processed with computer program. The red areas show most of the traits of a landslide, while yellow areas exhibit a few of the proxy traits.The program also uses data from GPM to help pin when each landslide occurred. The GPM core satellite measures rain and snow several times daily, allowing researchers to create maps of rain accumulation over 24-, 48-, and 72-hour periods for given areas of interest—a product they call Detecting Real-time Increased Precipitation, or DRIP. When a certain amount of rain has fallen in a region, an email can be sent to emergency responders and other interested parties.A new edition of , a bi-monthly publication that covers the nuts-and-bolts of , is out.

Hundreds of billions of tons of land ice melt into the ocean annually, raising sea levels worldwide. In recent years, meltwater from Greenland and Antarctica alone has raised global sea level by more than a millimeter a year, and the rate is increasing. In January 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey and NASA decided to open the full  image archive for public access on a non discriminatory, no-cost basis. This change in Landsat’s data policy ushered in a new era of Landsat data uses and applications while also revolutionizing the way Landsat has been woven into scientific discovery, economic prosperity, and public policy for management of land and water resources across a range of scales. From 1998 to the current 2018 fall term, the  has engaged 4,671 participants who have conducted 931 projects.

The first  identified  as a Tier-1 (i.e., highest) priority mission for development. The CLARREO Pre-Formulation Mission, referred to herein as the “Full” CLARREO mission, was recommended to better understand climate change.

NASA has funded five new projects to develop tools and technology to make the agency’s massive Earth science datasets more accessible and user-friendly.Wake up. Turn on laptop. Start processing airborne data of the Adirondack forests in New York. Make Coffee. Eat Breakfast. Fasten the open laptop’s seatbelt in the passenger seat as it continues to crunch numbers. Drive to work.That used to be Sara Lubkin’s morning routine as an early career scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Once at work, she would use her desktop computer, while her laptop diligently spent the next 12 hours processing airborne instrument data for the relevant information she needed to study invasive pests of hemlock trees.“I’m not a computer scientist, I’m an Earth scientist,” said Lubkin, who now works as a program officer for NASA Earth Science Data Systems’ Advancing Collaborative Connections for Earth Systems Science, or ACCESS program. But her experience as a researcher is not unique.Spending large chunks of time simply getting Earth science data into a usable form for analysis is a common situation for researchers working with the big datasets that come from NASA field, airborne and satellite missions. Downloading huge files, converting data formats, locating the same study areas in multiple datasets, writing code to distinguish different land types in a satellite image – these types of tasks eat into time scientists would rather be using to analyze the actual information in the data.That’s where the ACCESS program comes in. Part of the Earth Science Data Systems division since 2005, ACCESS finds innovative ways to streamline that cumbersome processing time. The program funds two-year research projects to improve behind-the-scenes data management and provide ready-to-use datasets and services to scientists, Lubkin said.In June, NASA selected five teams of NASA, university and commercial computer science researchers from the 2017 round of submissions in a range of projects that will use machine learning, cloud computing and advanced search capabilities to develop tools to improve the behind-the-scenes management for selected NASA datasets.“We continually invest in development and evaluation of the newest technologies to improve science data systems,” said Kevin Murphy, program executive for NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems at NASA Headquarters in Washington. But more than that, they want to make sure that the tools and technology help real scientists address real problems.Each ACCESS project has Earth scientists and computer scientists involved from beginning to end, Murphy said. “With the ACCESS program, we’re really trying to understand, for example, how ocean currents work, but we’re trying to do that now with data that’s so large that we need a team of experts who can work together to solve the big science and big data questions.”The projects will complement data management, distribution and other services provided by the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), which manages and stores NASA data collected from Earth-observing satellites, aircraft and field campaigns. EOSDIS has 12 interconnected data and archive centers located across the United States, which are organized by discipline. Currently, these centers host 26 petabytes of Earth datasets – that’s 26 million gigabytes, or enough data to need 52,000 computers each with 500 gigabytes of storage space. That number is expected to grow to 150 petabytes within five years with the launch of new satellites.“Satellite data is big data,” said Jeff Walter, one of the ACCESS 2017 principal investigators and lead engineer for Science Data Services at the Atmospheric Science Data Center at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. “It’s very complex and sometimes difficult to use, even for expert users. In addition to the volume, which makes it difficult for users to acquire, store and manage, there’s also the complexity of both the format and content. Users often have to spend a lot of time understanding how the data is organized and what the various parameters represent.”Walter’s project is one of three that will use cloud computing to alleviate download and storage issues for users. Starting with two atmospheric datasets, his team will also be developing a way to convert satellite data formats into those that can be read by commercial geospatial information system (GIS) software.“Our project aims to lower the barrier to entry for a potential new user community who might find novel ways to use this data, and who are more familiar with GIS types of tools,” Walter said.The two other cloud computing projects will be developing open source processing and analysis tools, including one designed for ocean datasets. A fourth project will use machine learning to detect changes over time in land observations, starting with the detection of landslides, floods and uplift caused by volcanic activity. The fifth project will develop an automated method for lining up datasets that observe the same location so researchers can combine more than one type of information about a place.Upon completion, the ACCESS researchers will work closely with EOSDIS teams to incorporate their advancements into the data centers’ day-to-day operations. Once those new tools are in place, that’s when the real power of open and freely available Earth science datasets can flourish, according to Murphy. Easy-to-use data means it gets into the hands of decision-makers, non-governmental organizations, scientists studying related applications and researchers in different fields that may have new uses for it.“When you make these products open and accessible, you have a lot of unintended, good scientific consequences,” Murphy said, citing examples that include detecting groundwater movement from space, rapid wildfire detection and using night lights to study human energy use. “NASA has a lot of very valuable information, and the ACCESS program really tries to help scientists to not only address primary science questions but also help us understand our environment and plan for our future.”To learn more about ACCESS, visit To learn more about NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems, visit Sure, space or at least .

Collier Trophy would be awarded to the NASA Hubble Space Telescope Recovery Team \"for outstanding leadership, intrepidity, and the renewal of public faith in America''s space program by the successful orbital recovery and repair of the Hubble Space Telescope.\" Representing the more than 1,200 men and women directly involved in the mission, the seven-person astronaut crew of Space Shuttle Mission STS-61 and four ground managers were named as the recipients. It was truly, by all assessments of the participants and the observers and in the language of the Collier award, \"the greatest achievement.\" The Hubble Space Telescope had taken longer to build and launch than any other NASA spacecraft, including Apollo. It had cost more than any other scientific space program, and more than nearly any other space mission. Deployed in the Spring of 1990 with the express mission of addressing the most enigmatic and exciting questions of astronomy, it promised a revolution in understanding the origin and evolution of the universe and myriad other astronomical and cosmological questions. Within weeks, a horrible realization gradually emerged: the instrument bore a seemingly fatal and irreparable manufacturing flaw that would severely degrade or even scuttle its fifteen-year mission. Worse, various other systems and components began to act erratically or to fail. Soon the Hubble Space Telescope and NASA itself were the objects of anger, scorn, and ridicule. What began even before launch as a planned and routine servicing mission grew into a bold and comprehensive overhaul, a \"rescue mission in space.\" The Hubble Space Telescope Recovery Team rescued more than just the telescope and its mission, however. By all accounts they rescued NASA and the U.S. space program as well.  This article is dedicated to Bob Bless, leader of the High Speed Photometer Team at the University of Wisconsin, who worked tirelessly for decades and in many ways to see the Space Telescope achieved, and then gracefully made room for COSTAR. I am grateful to a very large number of people who graciously gave freely of their time by sending or giving me information, oral history interviews, and informal discussions. The Hubble Servicing Mission was a massive effort that drew a dozen institutions and thousands of people into its cast. I have tried to give representative weight to the various contributors, but it would have been impossible within the limits of this brief article even to mention all their names. My own prior knowledge of the program from having worked on the Space Telescope History Project and the restoration and exhibit of the Space Telescope Structural Dynamic Test Vehicle was an important foundation for writing this article, and I am grateful to colleagues and friends at the Smithsonian Institution''s National Air and Space Museum, especially Robert W. Smith. Finally, as ever I am grateful to the NASA History Office, especially Director Roger Launius, for supporting this article. Needless to say, I am solely responsible for all conclusions and interpretations herein. 365 366 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION  FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 367In the introduction to this volume, Pamela E. Mack discerns a number of trends that altered the character of air and space flight over the eight decades of Collier awards:         Tellingly, the crew and ground managers were joined by beaming agency officials and politicians in postmission press conferences and events. When the telescope   368 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 369The servicing mission was successful in part because the users asserted themselves and interjected themselves forcefully into the process. The idea for the optical fix came from the user advocates. Implementing the fixes was possible because the other interests found their salvation through the needs of the users. If the development of the telescope illustrates the alienation of the users in big science and the dispersion of interests, its repair provides an illustration of how big science can work beautifully when interests merge. The servicing mission evolved from a diffused set of activities with many parties operating somewhat independently into a tightly focused and exquisitely choreographed group effort. It was well funded, had the rapt attention of management, and a working level  that transcended institutional and other loyalties. (3)  Some ill-chosen hyperboles aside, the Hubble Space Telescope''s benefits were as pure as the driven snow. It is hard to quantify the value of knowing better the nature, history, and origin of the universe in order to compare it to the cost of the telescope. The general public and its representatives might not comprehend fully the subtleties of astrophysics and cosmology, but they did expect at least entertainment and edification for the investment. While the several problems of the telescope affected all the instruments, not just the cameras, it was not fuzzy spectra or muddy digital data that became the public scandal, but rather \"blurred vision.\" The myriad of misleading and horribly muddled similes and analogies used to convey the problems and remedies all came down to the easily and instantly understood pictures and clarity. Even Senator Barbara Mikulski, herself one of the most knowledgeable and savvy advocates, referred to her outrage at the \"cataract\" and her elation at the successful \"contact lens.\" Hence, the Hubble servicing mission 370 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION\"That is a nice topic,\" said Alice, \"I will put the project in its historical perspective and draw analogies with other great scientific projects.\" \"Nonsense!\" said Humpty Dumpty, \"The answer is very short. Space Telescope will revolutionize mankind''s understanding of the Universe because it cost a billion dollars! That''s all. They wouldn''t have spent the money in the first place if it hadn''t been so, now would they?\"Initially, maintenance and refurbishment missions (including even return of the entire spacecraft for ground overhaul and then reflight) were part of the Space Telescope''s routine scenario. The first official NASA telescope planning phase began around 1971, just as the Space Shuttle was being defined. With austere times ahead after Apollo, the Space Telescope and the Space Shuttle soon found common cause. An orbital telescope of that size and cost could not be justified unless it could operate for years or decades, and to that end the Space Shuttle promised routine access for repair and upgrade. Lacking the Space Station, deleted from planning due to cost, the shuttle needed a place to go and useful work to do that could not be accomplished by expendable boosters. To that end, the Space Telescope and Space Shuttle pair became an exemplar of a new and cost-effective way of doing Earth orbital science. Initially projected at about two-and-a-half-year intervals over the fifteen-year life of the Telescope, such service calls were expected to be unproblematic and routine. Indeed, the frequency of access to the spacecraft, predicated on the presumed regular and routine shuttle traffic, was to have removed urgency. If something could not be accomplished on one call, it could wait until the next. It also meant that expensive pre-flight design and testing could be relaxed somewhat, secure in the knowledge that the spacecraft would be accessible for servicing. This notion of routine maintenance remained with the Telescope through its planning in the 1970s, its new start approval in 1977, and through some traumatic budgetary times in 1980. However, several unanticipated circumstances emerged to cast the spotlight on maintaining the Hubble Space Telescope and to raise the stakes. First, early in 1983 NASA Administrator James Beggs was startled to be told, on the very eve of release of the President''s budget for fiscal year 1984, that the program was once again significantly over budget and behind schedule. The full extent of the crisis emerged over the following few months, and provoked painful congressional hearings,   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 371shakeups of the program and project management, and serious loss of political capital. By the time the new launch target date was in place, and the new budget understood, the program was operating under \"last chance\" understandings. It could not go back to the well again, and the program remained under scrutiny from within and without NASA. One salutory effect of the reorganization was that some orbital replaceable units, deleted earlier in the program for budgetary reasons, were reaffirmed, making the Telescope more easily maintainable than it otherwise might have been. Second, after recovering from this setback, the spacecraft was waiting in storage and testing at Lockheed''s Sunnyvale, California, plant when the Space Shuttle  accident in January 1986 halted all shuttle missions for an indefinite time. The Telescope program had to keep its \"marching army\" idling but consuming money during the resulting hiatus, contend with more conservative rules for shuttle bay payloads, and worry about the potential effect on the spacecraft of the unplanned-for extended storage. Moreover, the more conservative shuttle schedule, and even tighter budgets that emerged in the post- era, meant fewer and less-frequent future maintenance opportunities. The program was forced to absorb the additional costs without ability to obtain more money from without. The maintenance and refurbishment budget was an easy target, and money was shifted by adjusting the maintenance schedule and that for future replacement instruments. Some worried about how the spacecraft and its components would fare, not having been designed to reside in storage for so long. Others worried that new instruments would not be ready in time to replace inevitably aging and failing ones. Third, the Hubble Space Telescope became the centerpiece for recovering from  after effects. It was the largest and most complex scientific payload to be delivered to orbit, except perhaps the Galileo Jupiter probe. Unlike Galileo, which would take several years to reach its destination and return data, the Hubble Space Telescope would start providing results in only a few days or weeks of deployment. As launch neared, the press and media coverage was enormous. When the Space Shuttle  roared from the launch pad on April 24, 1990, occupying nearly all of the payload bay was an enormously complex spacecraft. Rather than the usual spacecraft with instruments attached, the Hubble Space Telescope was an immense collection of instruments enshrouded by a spacecraft and various appendages. At the heart, a cylindrical Optical Telescope Assembly held a 2.4 meter diameter primary mirror which would first receive the light from astronomical objects, reflect it forward to a 0.31 meter secondary mirror, which would then send the light back through a central hole in the primary mirror. just behind the primary mirror five scientific instruments and three fine guidance sensors, themselves large and complex assemblages of optics, motors, and electronics, would share the bundle of precisely focused light. Surrounding the Optical Telescope Assembly, the Support Systems Module contained dozens of electronic and mechanical black boxes to operate the ensemble, and sprouted two deployable antennas and two large solar arrays to generate electricity.   372 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSIONDesigned to be serviceable in orbit, the Hubble Space Telescope was the most mechanic-friendly spacecraft ever flown. Dozens of bright yellow hand holds and sockets for the astronauts'' portable foot restraints were strategically located around the spacecraft. Inside the multitude of hinged doors, all of the instruments and many of the black boxes could be removed and inserted by a space-suited astronaut using only a few tools. If motors or actuators failed, the solar arrays could be rolled up (like a window shade) or other appendages deployed or stowed using a ratchet wrench. Some of the deployment crew, notably astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathy Sullivan, had practiced various emergency procedures for years. McCandless had worked, off and on, for twenty years helping to develop the maintainable features of the Telescope and the special tools required. They had spent many hours in Lockheed''s clean room observing and working on the flight spacecraft itself, and in the water tanks at Marshall and Johnson working with various mockups. On April 25, astronaut and astronomer Steven Hawley grappled the spacecraft with the shuttle''s robot arm and eased the 12-ton railroad tank-car sized vehicle out of the payload bay. Still attached to the arm, a carefully orchestrated sequence of commands instructed the spacecraft to deploy its antennas and solar arrays. There was a tense period when one of the solar arrays got stuck, and McCandless and Sullivan donned their spacesuits, waiting inside  airlock, ready to go outside if necessary. Ground controllers freed the array, however, and in mid-afternoon only one orbit later than planned, Hawley released the Telescope. Within ten minutes the freely flying spacecraft had locked onto the Sun, and later maneuvered itself to point the delicate optics, protected by the still closed aperture door at the front, away from the dangerous sunlight. As  backed away, ground controllers began the complex sequence of commands to \"wake up\" the various dormant systems of the Telescope and prepare it for its fifteen-year mission. McCandless and Sullivan doffed their spacesuits, and with the rest of the crew continued  flight, the toolboxes never having been opened. Neither saw the Telescope again, and both left NASA shortly after the mission. Sullivan became chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. McCandless retired from NASA, leaving the maintenance of the Telescope to other astronauts who might never have seen it in person-or so he thought. The euphoria of the successful deployment was mixed with mild concern as the spacecraft encountered some initial problems. These had nothing to do with the mirror, but rather involved a variety of glitches with the communications antennas and the control systems. The spacecraft somewhat spastically and repeatedly shut itself down into several so-called \"safemodes\" in response to the motions of various appendages, and had to be coaxed back into operation. When, a few days after deployment the fine guidance sensors attempted to lock onto stars, correctible errors were discovered in the programming but a more persistent oscillation prevented the telescope from keeping itself pointed with the required accuracy.   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 373While engineers had forewarned before launch that such a complex spacecraft and ground system was bound to take some time to achieve stable operations, these initial problems earned the spacecraft some bad press that, in the words of a  story, \"has turned it into fodder for stand-up comics and prompted some citizens to murmur that it may be a $2.1 billion lemon.\" On May 15, 1990, late-night comedian David Letterman offered the \"Top Ten Hubble Telescope Excuses:\"   After stabilizing, but not solving these and other operational problems and taking the first test image a month after deployment, there was a brief period of almost giddy elation. By mid-June, however, some scientists had become more and more worried about subtle characteristics of the star images. This concern turned to near despair as scientists and engineers realized the reason for the Telescope''s inability to focus. The heart of the instrument, either the primary or the secondary mirror, or both (it would later turn out to be the primary) had been ground and polished over several years a decade earlier nearly perfectly to the wrong specifications. That this error had gone undetected over the years of testing was something most people within the program found too startling to believe. just convincing them that the problem lay with the optics was difficult-it took nearly a month, from late May to late June. Scientists and managers responded to the suggestion with a mixture of bewilderment and outright denial. Once the analyses had finally become too compelling to ignore, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science Lennard Fisk was told, and he responded that it might be space science''s equivalent of the  accident. A NASA press conference announcing the conclusion on June 27 showed a panel of somber faces, and the official making the first announcement literally stuttered over the words, \"spherical aberration.\" Outside the program and NASA, the news was received with less grace, and more outrage and even ridicule. Congressional representatives were furious, influential Senator and space enthusiast Barbara Mikulski, calling the Telescope a \"technoturkey,\" expressed outrage over Hubble''s \"cataract.\" Comedians and editorial cartoonists, from Herblock to Gary Larson''s Far Side, could hardly believe their good fortune. Even filmmakers were quick to seize on the opportunity, and before the year was out: \"An opening scene in the comedy film  features a dark lounge with a depressing atmosphere, downbeat music, and walls lined with pictures showing historically horrible disasters. There, between a picture of the Hindenburg and a half-sunk Titanic, is the Hubble Space Telescope.\"   374 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION Initially, many feared that NASA or Congress would finally decide to write off the loss. The first servicing mission, already planned for 1993, then became much more than a simple scheduled service call: It became the only chance to save the program and the spacecraft from either euthanasia or perhaps resignation to living with its diminished performance. Scientists and managers organized themselves along several strategic lines of work. While fending off the various congressional reviews, NASA Headquarters appointed a \"Hubble Space Telescope Optical Systems Failure Review Board,\" chaired by jet Propulsion Laboratory director Lew Allen. The Allen Committee, as it came to be called, began work in July and within a month had concluded the trouble lay with the main mirror. Investigating the records and the hardware that remained from the fabrication and testing of the mirror in 1980-1981, the Allen Committee found that a simple error in the test setup had skewed the measurement checks on the mirror, and that the computer-controlled polishing machine had dutifully shaped the mirror to the wrong curvature. Discordant test results at the time had been ignored under the schedule and cost pressures, and independent tests were not done. Eventually, the justice Department and Hughes Danbury Optical Systems (Hughes had earlier bought the portion of the Perkin Elmer Corporation that had built the Optical Telescope Assembly) settled out of court. While the Allen Committee was working to determine the cause of the spherical aberration, an HST Strategy Panel at the Space Telescope Science Institute under astronomers Holland Ford and Robert A. Brown began work to determine options for recovering from the mirror problem. The Science Institute had been established long before launch to be the focus for the academic community who wished to use the Telescope. With Goddard managing the mission and controlling the Telescope, the Science Institute would receive proposals from astronomers, manage peer review, and then work with the selected astronomers to schedule and obtain the desired observations. Institute staff included scientists who specialized in calibrating and understanding the Telescope''s instruments, and engineers who specialized in merging thousands of approved observation requests into an efficient observing schedule. Under the leadership of the assertive and persistent Riccardo Giacconi, the Science Institute had made itself the watchdog for the scientists, at times much to the consternation of NASA managers. They interpreted their charge broadly, and since well before launch had been proactive without much regard for stepping on government toes.   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 375At Goddard, the newly appointed Associate Director for Flight Projects for the HST Joe Rothenberg, and the Project Scientist, Al Boggess, met in late July to lay out a strategic recovery plan. First, they would do whatever science could be done with the Telescope in its current state; second, they would try to fix the Telescope''s problems at the 1993 maintenance opportunity; finally, they would concentrate on extending the wavelength coverage into the infrared on subsequent scheduled servicing missions that would install replacement instruments. Rothenberg was careful to establish close working relationships with the relevant Headquarters managers and with the Science Institute. Planners were very lucky that the figure of the mirror was so precisely and uniformly in error. Concurrent with the Allen Committee and the Strategy Panel, a \"Hubble Independent Optical Review Panel\" under Duncan Moore, University of Rochester Institute of Optics Director, worked to determine the precise prescription for the aberrated mirror, based on records and artifacts at the manufacturer and data taken by the Telescope instruments. The 2.4 meter wide main mirror was too flat by about 2 micrometers, or 1/40 the thickness of a human hair. That meant that an optical element with the reverse prescription could correct much of the aberration. It had already become clear that future replacements for the existing scientific instruments, scheduled to be inserted every few years beginning with the 1993 servicing mission, could incorporate internal optics that would reverse much of the aberration of the Telescope''s mirror. However, the existing five instruments and the fine guidance sensors (used by the astrometry team as a sixth virtual instrument) would remain severely compromised for many years unless some other solution were found. In particular, the European Space Agency''s Faint Object Camera had no follow-on in the plans, and it was scientifically as well as politically important to find some way to address the European concerns. The primary mirror defect had two serious consequences. First, because the light rays were not precisely brought to a single focus, the images would lack resolution and the other instruments could not pick out individual objects in crowded fields or very small features of extended objects. Second, because the light was diffused the Telescope''s instruments could not reach the planned limits of faintness. These two desiderata, clarity and faintness, were precisely the reasons for putting a Telescope of this size above the atmosphere in the first place. While the Telescope was still capable of providing valuable data and addressing much of its observing program, it was compromised in the areas for which it was supposed to be uniquely suited. The existence of a very serious flaw that was nonetheless amenable to compensation was the foundation for an expanded servicing mission. The Hubble Space Telescope Strategy Panel included many distinguished and experienced astronomers and engineers, as well as retired astronaut Bruce McCandless to advise on the on-orbit feasibility of various proposals. Co-Chair Robert Brown had served as Space Telescope Project Scientist for several years before launch. The Panel considered a wide variety of schemes, including: mechanically or thermally slightly deforming the main mirror; overcoating the main mirror to alter its shape; installing full-aperture glass or gas-filled corrective optics at the front of the telescope; replacing the secondary mirror.   376 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSIONThese and other proposals were all found wanting, or downright dangerous (to the Telescope or to the astronauts) to various degrees. The Panel also considered how to incorporate changes into the planned replacement instruments scheduled to be installed every few years starting with the 1993 servicing mission. Bits and pieces of the solution lay near to hand, but would require innovative modifications. As a precaution, work had begun at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the early 1980s on a replacement for the main imaging camera, the Wide Field/Planetary Camera. Its internal optics would be modified by adding small mirrors figured to reverse much-of the spherical aberration introduced by the main mirror. Early in the HST Strategy Panel discussions, optical expert Murk Bottema, of Ball Aerospace, suggested using mirrors similar to those in the replacement Wide Field-Planetary Camera II to adjust the incoming light for the other, axial scientific instruments. The problem was how to deliver such mirrors to the Telescope and insert them precisely into the light bundle behind the main mirror. The solution to this problem, due to electrical engineer James Crocker of the Space Telescope Science Institute is so remarkable as to seem apocryphal. One evening, during the Strategy Panel''s meeting at the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility in Garching, German, Crocker stepped into the shower in his hotel room. The European-style fixtures included a shower-head on an arrangement of adjustable rods. While manipulating the shower, Crocker realized that similar articulated arms bearing Bottema ''s mirrors could be-extended into the light bundle from within a replacement axial instrument by remote control: \"I could see Murk Bottema''s mirrors on the shower head.\" In the early 1980s, work had begun on a device called STAR, Space Telescope Axial Replacement, an empty stand-in for one of the four axial scientific instruments, just in case one might have to be removed with no new instrument available for insertion. STAR was designed to be mechanically, thermally, and in other ways benign, so that the complex spacecraft would not \"notice\" the missing instrument. With Bottema''s mirrors and Crocker''s mechanical arrangement packed inside, STAR would become COSTAR, Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement. Once installed as if it were a replacement axial instrument, COSTAR would deploy the tiny mirrors, each figured to intercept and then reverse the spherical aberration for that portion of incoming light directed to various apertures of the remaining three axial instruments. The three remaining axial instruments had a total of five precisely-placed entrance apertures, and the optical design required two mirrors for each. Thus, ten mirrors had to be inserted into the light path in such a way as to intercept the light, correct it, and direct it into the apertures, all   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 377the while precisely shadowing the apertures from the flood of the remaining aberrated light. COSTAR was an exceptionally complex and delicate system of 5,300 parts including mirrors, mechanical components, and electronics all controllable from the ground. Some of the coin-sized mirrors were an optician''s nightmare to figure, their shapes being \"anamorphic fourth-order aspheres on toroidal blanks,\" painstakingly hand-made by Tinsley Optics in California. COSTAR would \"fix\" the European Faint Object Camera, the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph, and the Faint Object Spectrograph, and the replacement Wide Field-Planetary Camera would restore the primary imaging camera abilities. Astrometry and pointing control would have to live with the diminished performance of the Fine Guidance Sensors, and the High Speed Photometer, the least problematic but the least-used instrument, would have to give up its spot for COSTAR. Having settled on the COSTAR approach, Ball Aerospace began design and proposal work in November, and was awarded a contract in January 1991. Ball had built the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph for the telescope, and was designing two second generation scientific instruments for future servicing missions. The first servicing mission now included replacing two scientific instruments and it would have to remedy a host of other emerging problems, some of which were becoming very serious. At the end of 1990, engineers operating the telescope had devised software changes to try to counter the oscillations of the solar arrays, which would respond sharply to passage between shade and the Sun that occurred twice each 90-minute orbit. The thermally-induced oscillations slowly damped out, but took longer than half an orbit to do so, when another passage would start them all over again. There was limited available memory in the onboard computers, and the new control laws to handle the solar array oscillations consumed a good portion of it. Solar array replacement looked as though it would have to join the other maintenance tasks, although the final decision to replace the European-provided solar arrays was not made until much later. After a spirited debate, they even edged out the optical fixes to assume highest priority. The Telescope continued to be temperamental, and NASA finally decided in late 1990 that the engineering commissioning phase, called Orbital Verification, was complete —or that they had gotten the spacecraft operating about as well as they could and regular science operations should wait no longer. The Marshall Space Flight Center team who had been in residence since deployment returned to Huntsville, leaving Goddard Space Flight Center to operate the spacecraft and the Space Telescope Science Institute to continue its work coordinating observing proposals, scheduling objects to be observed, calibrating the instruments, and archiving the data. Between the degraded focus, solar array oscillations, the fine guidance sensors acting temperamentally, and a variety of other sporadic problems, all of the observing plans were continually in flux. Various observing programs, planned with the full capability in mind, had to be reassessed and sometimes deferred. The operational problems had further made scheduling difficult, both by degrading observations and also taking up scheduled observing time to resolve.   378 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSIONDuring 1991, the teams settled into doing the observing programs not preempted by the hardware problems, while developing COSTAR and the other major hardware for the servicing mission. Ball Aerospace began assembling hardware for COSTAR in July, receiving the first flight optics at the end of the year. As the servicing mission planning group considered how to include the new tasks (they had been meeting formally since August 1988), they found themselves under pressure to include still more. In May, a memory unit in the spacecraft''s main computer failed, sending the Telescope into the deepest safemode available, nearly the equivalent of a coma. In June, a second of six gyroscopes failed, leaving only one spare since three were required for the spacecraft to determine its position and attitude accurately enough to conduct observations. In July, the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph developed a problem in its power supply, eliminating half of its capability. By the end of the year, it was clear that the first servicing mission was going to be much more ambitious than anyone had expected. It would be more of an overhaul than a repair. Cost estimates are difficult, both for the servicing mission and for the Telescope as a whole, but the repair cost a significantly large fraction of the Telescope''s initial cost. Had it been an automobile, it might well have been declared a total loss. The close cooperation required of so many parts of NASA, combined with the high stakes and growing anxiety evident in Washington, encouraged a number of institutional clashes that had to be overcome. To the managers and astronauts at the Johnson Space Center, the servicing mission at first appeared as one among others, and it never occurred to them to treat it any differently. Confident and proud of their system for planning and executing Space Shuttle missions, with a host of other missions at various stages of execution, and already interacting with various institutional \"customers\" for those missions, Johnson was slow to change its approach. As Headquarters scrutiny increased, the complexity of the mission grew, and the need for more subtle interaction with other elements of the program became more apparent, Johnson managers began to feel the pressure . The result was that planning for the mission at Johnson accelerated much earlier than was their typical procedure. For \"customer driven\" missions, a multidisciplinary and multiinstitutional Payload Operations Working Group would spend one or more years developing the outlines of a mission. Actual flight crews and ground controllers were seldom selected earlier than a year before launch. In the Spring of 1992, some twenty months before launch, Story Musgrave was the first crew member named. Musgrave, an Apollo-era veteran, polymath, and extremely accomplished in extravehicular activity, would be the Payload Commander, foreman for the repair crew and ultimately responsible for the Telescope. Musgrave had started working on making satellites maintainable and serviceable in orbit in 1976, and had been the astronaut most involved in developing the space suits and other equipment. Eleven astronauts began sixteen sessions in Marshall''s Neutral   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 379Buoyancy Simulator, working with mockups in simulated underwater microgravity to obtain rough approximations of the times required to do various maintenance tasks. All the while, new black box failures on the spacecraft put pressure on the roster of chores to be accomplished. At about the same time, J. Milton Heflin was chosen lead flight director. With almost thirty years experience at Johnson, Heflin had been involved in ocean recovery of the Apollo astronauts, and had been in mission control since the very first shuttle landing tests in 1977. With ten years and twenty shuttle missions under his belt as a flight director, he was one of the most experienced and seasoned. As Heflin got organized, he was also supporting several other missions as well. He, like most at JSC, recognized that the Hubble Servicing Mission was challenging and needed more attention than some other missions. He would soon realize, however, just how much more attention and resources it would require. Initially, the core of his mission control team included payloads officer Jeff Hanley, robot arm engineer Sal Ferrera, and extravehicular activity experts Jim Thornton and Susan B. Rainwater. Meanwhile, events in Washington transpired that would have decisive and far-reaching effects on the agency and on the Hubble servicing mission. In early 1992, after escalating discord with the White House, Richard Truly was effectively fired as NASA Administrator. Truly, a career astronaut, was admired and respected throughout the agency but perhaps nowhere more than at Johnson. By March, a new, non-NASA face appeared and was confirmed on April 1. Not perhaps since James Webb had there been a NASA Administrator who was more of an outsider, more inscrutable, or more difficult to adjust to, than Daniel Goldin. Having worked in mostly classified space programs at TRW, Goldin was expected to bring a no-nonsense industrial agility and accountability to the agency. The Bush-Quayle administration had decided that Truly was too closely identified with the old guard, and were determined to bring a fresh approach to NASA. While Goldin championed what he considered to be NASA''s strengths, and went out of his way to praise the achievements of NASA, he was determined to bring change to the agency. To some old hands Goldin seemed impulsive, abrasive, and fearfully insensitive to the agency''s core traditions and values. To Johnson, anyone who replaced the beloved Richard Truly, under duress no less, boded ill. Stories of strife in \"Code A,\" the office of the Administrator, were rife.   380 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSIONThe strong signals of change grew more potent when, in May, Marine Major General Jeremiah W. \"Jed\" Pearson III replaced astronaut William B. Lenoir as Associate Administrator for the Office of Space Flight (\"Code M\"). Pearson had been deputy commander of Marine forces in Operation Desert Storm before serving briefly at Marine Headquarters, and he now commanded the very heart and soul of NASA —the Space Shuttle program. Goldin continued to replace many Headquarters and Center officials, while the old hands at the agency went through the anxiety of organizational change. In mid-May Goldin traveled to Johnson to observe a Space Shuttle mission first-hand. The STS-49  crew''s mission was to capture and repair the  communications satellite and evaluate Space Station construction techniques.  apogee kick motor had failed two years earlier, leaving it stranded in a low orbit. The crew was to approach the spinning satellite, insert a special tool into the central motor chamber about which it turned, and fire a grappling device that would seize the chamber, allowing them to slow it down. Once stabilized, they would repair it and then send it on its way to geostationary orbit. Problems developed almost immediately. The four and one half ton satellite bounced away each time Pierre Thuot, in foot restraints at the end of the robot arm, tried to thrust the capture bar into position. Worse, it began to wobble, and fearing that further attempts might be too dangerous they decided to quit for the day and revisit their options. The seven million dollars capture bar had worked during numerous ground simulations. Something was wrong. Overnight, the crew worked with ground planners and astronauts in simulators to devise a bold contingency plan. The next day, after the capture bar again failed to work, for the first time in history, three astronauts were outside their spacecraft at once. Thuot, Richard Hieb, and Thomas Akers, \"the gang of three,\" stationed themselves in a circle in the payload bay, their feet anchored in restraints, while pilot Dan Brandenstein eased the shuttle toward the spinning satellite. They used their gloved hands to reach out, grab, brake  to a stop, and then lower it into its repair fixture. While the crew repaired the satellite and sent it on its way to geosynchronous orbit, they were hailed as \"space wizards.\" Goldin praised the bold move as a \"return to [the] can-do NASA of old,\" and editorials and commentaries gushed about the drama of the satellite rescue and its proof of the usefulness of astronauts. However, outside the limelight, it \"set NASA managers scrambling to rethink their training methods and assumptions about handling large masses in orbit.\" The flight and ground crews had saved the mission, but they had taken what some considered to be undue, perhaps even foolhardy risks. Caught between deeply engrained and conflicting values, Johnson had been torn between conservatism and safety, on the one hand, and the driving desire to complete the mission, on the other. They had chosen deliberately on the ground and in space to be bold and complete the task. Tom Akers and Kathy Thornton ran into further problems assembling prototype Space Station elements in the payload bay later in the mission. This, too, did not go as it had in simulations and training. It shook Johnson''s planning, training, and simulation groups to the core.   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 381Worse, while Goldin praised publicly his charges for the daring satellite rescue, he is remembered by others to have commented on \"those cowboys!\" Barely six weeks into his tenure as NASA Administrator, this was not getting off on the right foot. While Johnson quietly looked inward to reassess their training methods, Goldin appointed a high-level group task force on satellite rescue and repair to study how NASA should handle future such situations. Implications for the Space Station and the Hubble servicing mission were not lost on anyone. Center Directors and Headquarters Associate Administrators decided they, too, needed to track the servicing mission more closely. By the end of July, four new review teams were looking at the Hubble servicing mission, and many more would follow. At the end of August, sixteen months before launch, three astronauts were named to join Story Musgrave as the extravehicular activity contingent for the servicing mission, making it the most experienced and seasoned crew ever: Tom Akers, Kathy Thornton, and Jeff Hoffman. A lot of work was scheduled in Marshall''s Neutral Buoyancy Simulator and Johnson''s Weightless Environmental Training Facility to refine further the timelines for the servicing mission, and \"EVAs of opportunity\" were inserted into upcoming shuttle missions wherever possible to gain more experience. In January 1993, on STS-54, Mario Runco and Greg Harbaugh of the  crew improvised the first of these by carrying one another around the payload bay in a \"mass handling\" exercise and tested some new tools. Several other crews practiced aspects of the repair mission in orbit, spacewalks being added at every possible opportunity. Meanwhile, the Telescope continued to be a problem child. In September 1992, the Faint Object Camera''s power supply developed problems eliminating half of that instrument''s capabilities. A third gyroscope failed, leaving the Telescope running on its minimum complement of three. If another gyroscope were to fail, the spacecraft would be safe but unable to collect any scientific data. A second flight computer memory unit failed. Most of these failures added relatively easy individual tasks to the servicing mission, but the timelines were already overbooked and confidence in them somewhat shaken by the new conservatism. They also caused a scramble among spacecraft engineers to determine which problems could be repaired at all, and of those which had highest priority. Goddard and the Science Institute, resigned to operating what had become a positively cantankerous spacecraft, became quite adept at dealing with sudden hiccups and replanning observations again and again. The Goddard controllers and scientists had been operating astronomical spacecraft for thirty years. In particular, they could draw on their experience and institutional memory of the remarkable International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), which had survived well beyond its design life. They had even learned to operate IUE on a single gyroscope. It was befitting that in the IUE control room sat a stuffed toy \"Energizer Bunny.\" Beginning at the end of the summer of 1991, after the   382 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSIONshock and denial had run its course, the astronomers and operators had resolved to make the most of the capabilities they had. The first science results were published in  at the end of 1991. By the end of 1992, astronomers had accumulated a respectable suite of results, some of which surprised even themselves. The Telescope was performing at a level somewhat better than Earth-based telescopes, but far below its expected capabilities. In December 1992, a year before launch and at about the time it would have been usual to first assign a crew, Richard Covey (Commander), Ken Bowersox (Pilot), and Claude Nicollier (a European Space Agency astronaut and expert on the robot arm) were named to complete the STS-61 flight crew. With these three, the servicing mission continued to enjoy the most experienced and seasoned astronauts available, now with sixteen previous shuttle flights among them. Also in December, a new face at Johnson was named to a position that had not been used since Apollo: Randy Brinkley was to occupy the newly created position of Mission Director. Brinkley and his position were controversial from the first at Johnson, even though the post had been recommended by former Astronaut Thomas Stafford''s review of the servicing mission. \"Badged Headquarters,\" Brinkley reported to Washington but was located at and carried on his work at Johnson. The term carried special significance at Johnson, originally created as the Manned Spacecraft Center in the early 1960s. The Space Task Group, a small band of space enthusiasts among aeronauticists at the Virginia Langley Research Center, had virtually invented human space flight at NASA. As Apollo grew into a behemoth, Headquarters decided to create a new Center on some politically favorable bayside land south of Houston. The space pioneers from Langley had little choice but to leave the Hampton, Virginia, area that many of them loved, for to resist moving to Houston meant to be out of the action. They built the space center from the ground up, developing all the camaraderie and social structures of pioneers, and absorbing much of the rugged, self-reliant culture of Texas. They developed and flew Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and the Space Shuttle. They invented astronaut training, mission control, and spacewalking. At JSC, as they referred to their institution, they operated a veritable space university, with several associated colleges where they trained recruits in how to operate in space and support space flight from the ground. Through Apollo and into the shuttle era there had been a constant tension between Headquarters and JSC, a continually and dynamically negotiated balance of independence and subordination. From Webb onward, Headquarters administrators had placed personnel at JSC who reported not to the Center but to Headquarters. Brinkley had been at Johnson for several months as a special assistant to Headquarters'' space flight chief Jed Pearson before being appointed to the servicing mission. A Marine aviator for twenty-five years, he had served with Pearson during Desert Storm and then later   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 383spent a brief time with McDonnell Douglas. Before taking on the servicing mission, Brinkley had studied the shuttle program and tried to get oriented, absorbing some aspects of the JSC culture in the process. He had been impressed by JSC''s technical competence, but no less by its independence and his own difficulty in \"break[ing] into that subculture.\" Brinkley researched the Mission Director concept and tried to figure out how to implement it, seeking the advice of many old hands. His charter was broad, to ensure the success of the servicing mission, and largely undefined: \"I knew I had the responsibility,\" he recalled, \"somehow I had to grow my own authority.'''' This was a broad mission order commonly used in the Marine Corps, similar to others Brinkley had received there, and in keeping with Pearson''s style. Brinkley assembled a small staff, representative of the various kinds of inside expertise he would need. He had also, early on, been impressed by how important this mission was to many beyond JSC. From meetings with Pearson, Goldin, and congressional representatives (especially the plainspeaking Barbara Mikulski), the message he received was: \"this was a make or break mission for NASA ... Brinkley, don''t screw this up, the future of NASA lies in the balance.\" To gain insight into the progress of the many phases of the mission, he turned to using the independent review groups that had already been set up by others, and created some of his own. The many reviews, some of them uncoordinated and motivated by growing upper-level anxiety over the mission, put a great deal of pressure on the working troops. If Brinkley added to this pressure somewhat by commissioning still more reviews and assessments, he also drew gratitude from the workers by managing and coordinating the reviews and serving as somewhat of a lightning rod. \"Answering the mail from Headquarters,\" while initially not seen as much of a genuine contribution to the mission, eventually was seen as a valuable activity that allowed the people working on various aspects of the mission to function with minimal diversion. The various review recommendations and attention also gave the Hubble servicing mission team a good deal of clout in getting the resources they needed on a priority basis, clout which Brinkley was not afraid to exercise from time to time. This also caused some dismay among the crews of other missions competing for flight controllers, simulation and training time, and attention from the various technical service group. In January 1993, Administrator Goldin appointed the most formal and highest level review committee of all. Tapping Joseph F. Shea, an Apollo manager, and several senior aerospace executives and experts, he formed \"The Task Force on the Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission.\" After several formal meetings and numerous briefings at all the sites where the mission was being planned, the panel in May called the repair mission \"achievable\" but recommended continued close management attention, strongly endorsing the Mission Director concept. They were concerned about the \"escalating nature of the mission,\" and the \"instability\" of the plans and on-orbit schedule, based on a \"worrisome\" trend of equipment failures on the spacecraft.   384 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION The servicing mission itself lay at the confluence of several streams of work involving NASA Headquarters, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, four NASA Centers, the Space Telescope Science Institute, and a half-dozen contractors. During the summer of 1993, these streams would truly converge, and any residual turbulence had to be dealt with. Choreographing the mission was easily as challenging as any other aspect. Before and after capture, myriad instruments and systems on the spacecraft would have to be turned off systematically, the aperture door closed, antennas retracted, and solar arrays rolled up. The shuttle crew would have to grapple the spacecraft with the robot arm, and gingerly berth it into the receiving fixture of the payload bay where electrical connections could supply \"life support\" during the repairs. The Goddard controllers would have to watch the health of the spacecraft, putting some systems into standby and turning others off as the repair crews began to remove connectors and components, and then turning the systems back on afterward to ensure the \"aliveness\" of the new parts. As various access doors on the Telescope were opened, the shuttle''s attitude had to keep stray sunlight from entering the Telescope while still maintaining lock on the tracking and data relay satellites. The \"EVAs of opportunity\" inserted into the shuttle schedule during 1992-1993 revealed crucial information that probably was decisive in the success of the servicing mission. For various reasons the areas of the Telescope being worked on had to be kept out of sunlight. If subjected to sunlight, for example, the black insulation that suppressed interior reflections might \"outgas,\" exuding contaminants that might later deposit onto the optical surfaces. Solar heat might cause insulation to de-bond or expand. Over most of the extravehicular activity experience since Gemini, the problem had been keeping astronauts cool, since they were almost always in sunlight or reflected earthshine, and so the suits and gloves were very efficient at cooling. Mission designers, not taking crew temperatures into consideration, designed a trajectory optimum for the Telescope''s and orbiter''s needs. This oversight revealed itself dramatically and at a most inopportune time. In May 1993, Story Musgrave began a series of human thermal vacuum tests, similar to those done by many astronauts since Apollo. After four hours in the airlock, breathing oxygen in his suit to rid his blood of nitrogen, he finally entered the vacuum chamber for an experience he described as, \"the world''s worst hell. That''s the toughest day that you are ever going to have as an astronaut.\" Inside the black chamber, pumped down to the deepest vacuum possible, and dragging his counterbalanced 480-pound inflated suit \"like a plough horse,\" he started several hours of tool fit checks. His job was to go through all possible combinations of tools —sockets, ratchets, extensions— and fasteners to see whether they would fit and behave at a hundred and seventy degrees below zero. Even Musgrave himself, a medical doctor, did not realize what was happening as he squeezed the tools harder to get them to snap together and apart.  It was, he says, the \"insidiousness of going from pain to injury.\" Working in an inflated glove, and feeling numb anyway, he worked on for hours, occasionally pulling his fingers out of the gloves and up, the way a person in a parka might pull his hands into the sleeves, and occasionally trying to warm them in another part of the chamber that simulated sunlight temperatures. After finishing the fit checks, hours of decompressing, and emerging from the airlock, the metal on his suit was still too cold for anyone to approach. As he struggled to get his gloves off, and they dropped away, the damage was evident: severe frostbite, tissue death, in eight fingers.   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 385\"It was an essential thing which had to happen ... it redefined the entire EVA world,\" he said. John Young later noted that astronauts had \"complained of cold EVA temperatures for years,\" and Musgrave recalled cold hands on his very first shuttle spacewalk on STS-6 in April 1983. But previous shuttle astronauts had only been in the shade for portions of their spacewalks, and the Hubble mission would require them to work for extended periods away from sun- or earthshine. With only seven months to go before the mission, Musgrave was flown to be treated by frostbite experts at the University of Alaska, mission planners turned to reconsider extravehicular activity equipment and procedures, and high-level managers fretted. Musgrave recovered fully in time for the mission, and was even in the water tank within days of the injury. But the incident produced \"a whole new attitude\" —quite literally. John McCune, an experienced \"pointer\" who specialized in designing orbiter attitudes for missions, suggested flying an upcoming mission in the orbiter attitude planned for the servicing mission to learn about the thermal environment. Astronauts on STS-57 in June found that the payload bay was indeed far too cold for extended work. The mission design engineers went back to their computers to determine a series of orbiter attitudes that would keep the payload bay temperatures manageable, while keeping the direct sunlight out of the Telescope bays, accommodating the orbiter''s needs, yet still conserving already tight maneuvering propellant. Others developed warmer overgloves and other techniques, and revisited the idea of storing the tools inside the warmer (but already full) orbiter cabin rather than in the payload bay toolboxes. Had the cold hands problem emerged on-orbit, in the middle of the repairs, it could have been very serious, even disastrous. As it was, planners had to pull out a thread lightly interwoven throughout the warp and woof of a complex and interlocking mission. It took considerable cooperation between Goddard and Johnson to work out a new flight plan that would accommodate the new thermal requirements. Over the summer, as headquarters was preoccupied with President Clinton''s decision concerning the Space Station, Goddard engineers and astronomers tested and evaluated the instruments and other components in preparation for shipping them, in August, to the Kennedy Space Center. As the instruments and other components flowed through Goddard, they were subjected to multiple, independent, and rigorous testing to cross-check the results and avoid the kind of error that had befallen the mirror. At Goddard and the Science Institute, planners refined the complex and interlocking sequences of instructions that would have to be sent to the spacecraft to prepare each component for replacement and test its successor. Houston was occupied with preparing for joint integrated simulations of the mission. A total of seven would be held, August through November, and represented the most complex total exercise of any mission plan in the history of the shuttle program. With various astronauts in the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator at Marshall, ground controllers at mission control in Houston, and various supporting engineers and scientists at Goddard, the Science Institute, and contractor sites around the world, they would rehearse various parts of the mission as well as numerous \"failures\" concocted by the simulation super-visors. One recommendation from several of the review teams concerned increasing the fidelity of the water tank simulations. The robot arm at Marshall''s Neutral Buoyancy Simulator was crude, and planning began on a higher-fidelity version. Johnson''s tank was too shallow to accomodate an arm. Also, to allow longer and more realistic simulations plans were made to install a nitrogen-oxygen (\"nitrox\") breathing mixture, which would allow simulations of entire six-hour spacewalks, rather than having to break them up into smaller portions. Here Brinkley ran into center parochialism, as the upgrades to the   386 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSIONMarshall tank were seen by some as competing with proposals to upgrade the much smaller and more-limited Johnson Weightless Environmental Training Facility to a full Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, conveniently available to Houston flight crews. After paperwork \"got lost\" along the way, the changes were finally implemented barely in time for the October simulations. The flight crew took advantage of the long water tank simulations to hone their bodies and their spirits as well. They would have only one chance on-orbit, and so prepared for that as if it were the Olympics. \"We did things at Marshall like we were going to do upstairs ... at seven a.m. we would be in there and we would brief what we were going to do, and then we would position our tools ... then we''d get in the suit, and then we would go work, we''d do six or seven hours there, we would get out, we would debrief how everything went, we''d capture our lessons [learned]. Then we went off to the gym.... we would put in an hour and a half or two.... yeah, hard work ... then we would come back from there ... and start talking about and reviewing the next day''s activities ... and then it''s ten p.m. and at 7 a.m. we''re back at Marshall and the whole day repeats, and we did this day after day after day without missing a day for three weeks. Now, you wonder why it worked?\" Brinkley \"wasn''t worried about the flight team,\" but was worried about upper level management''s readiness for real-time decision making. Brinkley found that previous mission simulations had effectively concentrated on exercising decision-making among the crew, flight controllers, and the many \"back room\" technical groups that advise them. Generally, decisions that were too serious to be made within mission control had relied on a Mission Operations Director console position, the occupant of which would be the Flight Director''s interface to the upper management. During the joint integrated simulations, a real-time mission management team comprising administrators from the highest levels of the agency participated and were faced with contrived situations that pitted the \"safety of the orbiter versus the survival of the Hubble.\" Associate Administrators for Space Science (Wes Huntress), Space Flight (Jed Pearson), and Center Directors (John Klineberg, Goddard) worked with the team to practice how they would confront such situations during the flight.  In addition to the water tank simulations (738 hours), several other areas of ground training enjoyed renewed emphasis. Since the viscosity of the water tended to make handling massive objects less realistic, an air-bearing floor simulator was used to gain more realistic experience in the dynamics. Twenty hours of manned thermal vacuum tests were done. Computer graphics virtual reality simulators were developed, and were used to research positions for the crew and robot arm to use on the repairs. In the Manipulator Development Facility, Claude Nicollier and Ken Bowersox worked with a realistic robot arm, hoisting full-scale helium-filled balloons in the shape of Hubble and of a spacesuited astronaut (nicknamed \"Gumby\") .   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 387At the High Fidelity Mechanical Simulator at Goddard, the crew practiced replacing components using highly realistic models and even flight hardware. Goddard had built the simulator, which reproduced the aft portions of the telescope, where the instruments fit, and the equipment bays that held the various electronics components, so that replacement and new components could be checked accurately on the ground. In addition to being responsible for the Hubble Space Telescope, Goddard had worked on satellite servicing concepts since the early 1970s, developing tools and techniques used on other earth-orbiting spacecraft. Rothenberg, Frank Ceppolina, and others had been sensitized to the minute detail required in testing and training simulators by many experiences, among which was the repair of the Solar Maximum mission spacecraft on STS-41C in 1984. There, astronauts had been temporarily halted by a small piece of insulation that had sagged out of place. Goddard also maintained a separate electrical simulator for testing the numerous data and control connections. Most of the components for the servicing mission would travel to the launch site via Goddard''s clean room, where they would be tested and where the crew would have a chance to work with real hardware. \"Goddard was just magnificent in knowing how to get a crew ready ... they were much more than just the customer ... they were EVA trainers, they swam with us all the time ...,\"Musgrave recalled. The astronauts also went to various other locations around the country and in Europe to see and handle the actual flight hardware. They even went to the Smithsonian''s National Air and Space Museum, riding a cherry picker crane after-hours to inspect the old Structural Dynamic Test Vehicle. The only full-scale version of the telescope to have been built in a program that tried to save money by building only one full-fledged flight spacecraft and no prototypes, the vehicle had served as a wireform on which the 25 miles of flight wiring had been laid out. Not realistic in many respects, the carefully restored and preserved artifact nonetheless retained the many simulated connectors and black boxes where the cabling now in space had once been meticulously strung. Unlike the more aesthetic models built later to represent the flight spacecraft, this vehicle did not have a covering of multilayer insulation to get in the way and obscure details. The Hubble Space Telescope program had eschewed building prototypes, and so there was no single place the crew and engineers could go to see a truly accurate and completely realistic version of the spacecraft that orbited more than three hundred miles up. There had arisen by necessity a panoply of mockups, models, and simulators, supplemented by thousands of photographs and video tapes taken of the flight spacecraft before it left the ground. Each was accurate in some important respects, yet each was dangerously misleading in most other respects. To get the whole picture, it all had to be synthesized in the mind. No one experience was adequate, and all had defects. The astronaut would have to pick out mentally the appropriate parts of each training exercise and suppress the rest. Musgrave described what it was like:    388 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSIONSuch an ambitious and expensive servicing mission might never have been seriously considered had not much more than the Hubble Space Telescope been riding on it. The Space Station had long been NASA''s choice for the next logical step beyond the shuttle. As the Hubble Space Telescope''s problems and their potential solutions emerged, and with the new awareness of the difficulty of spacewalking under certain circumstances, planning work on space station assembly revealed that it would require an unprecedented amount of extravehicular activity. With only the restrictive volume and weight capacity of the shuttle, assembling the Space Station seemed to call for spacewalks in a nearly implausible number, duration, and complexity and variety of tasks. Review committees questioned seriously whether such a scenario was reasonable. A successful Hubble servicing mission would provide dramatic proof that the Space Station assembly could be done. While the reviews of the servicing plans were going on in the summer of 1993, President Clinton was making an important and extremely contested decision concerning the future form of the Space Station. The Space Station \"Freedom\" of the Bush administration was replaced by Space Station \"Alpha,\" a less-ambitious and less-costly version. That a space station at all emerged from the presidential decision process was cause for rejoicing, but it was now tied more firmly to the success of the Hubble servicing mission. Later in the summer, several other unfortunate events served to tarnish further NASA''s reputation and raise the stakes. A weather resources satellite,  failed shortly after launch in early August. The Galileo spacecraft, enroute to Jupiter after a perils-of-Pauline life of its own, had been unable to deploy its high-gain antenna, and attempts to free it seemed doomed, threatening the viability of its mission. The next shuttle mission, STS-51, was delayed from its late July launch date because of concerns about a particularly active annual Perseid meteor shower. When  finally flew in mid-September, the crew tested Hubble tools on-orbit during a full seven-hour spacewalk September 16, 1993.   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 389The most serious, and mysterious, mishap of those remarkable few weeks, however, was the  spacecraft which, on the verge of entering Mars orbit suddenly went silent. Again the cries of critics rose to a din and NASA suffered the barbs of pundits. On September 6, 1993, NASA was honored with its second Dave Letter-man Top Ten list. In addition, 1993 was a frustrating year for the shuttle program. By mid-August, four launch countdowns had proceeded to within twenty seconds of ignition and had to be scrubbed for various reasons. Two had actually ignited the main engines and then shutdown just a split second before the solid rocket boosters were to ignite-the point of no return in a launch. In October, the  satellite''s kick motor failed after launch, leaving the Earth resources satellite stranded and useless. Some of these untoward events were not even within NASA''s responsibility or control, and others were only remotely related to the Hubble mission, if at all, yet the servicing mission was acquiring a significance far beyond just repairing the Telescope. While upper-level managers worried about the larger picture, engineers and astronauts tried to maintain their focus on the details that would make or break the mission. As Musgrave recalled: \"Did the pressure come to me? No. It''s out there, and I know it''s out there. But I am gonna go do my job, apart from the pressure and apart from the outside world. I''m the ballerina, and I know the opera company may be resting on my shoulders. OR, it''s tough, but I''m gonna go do what I''ve got to do. It doesn''t matter that the opera company is resting on my shoulders, or isn''t. It''s my art, and I''m going to perfect it to the best of my ability, and it''s me and it''s my art.... Yes, there''s pressure, but it''s not external pressure, it''s internal.\" By December, as launch approached, nearly every press story on the mission declared it to be do-or-die. It was a mission of superlatives: more spacewalks, by more astronauts, for more total time than ever-before attempted; one-chance to rendezvous; no second chance to rendezvous once the telescope was released at the end of the repairs. The complexity and high stakes of the mission were reflected in the unprecedented series of reviews, so numerous and extensive that some feared the mission was being reviewed to death, and that the preparation required for these reviews was taking resources away from the mission itself. By the November 17, 1993, Flight Readiness Review, 195 formal recommendations had been made by twelve review teams, of which only twenty-seven remained to be closed. When the priorities for various repairs were put alongside the order in which certain tasks had to be done, it was not possible to do the various tasks one after the other using 6-hour spacewalks. In priority order, the tasks for full mission success were: solar arrays; two gyroscopes; Wide Field-Planetary Camera; COSTAR; magnetometer; and Solar Array Drive Electronics. Minimum success would be three reliable gyroscopes and an operational WF/PC II or COSTAR. Secondary objectives would include a fix for the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph, a 386 coprocessor to replace the failed computer memory, a sccond magnetometer, and gyroscope control electronics. The final timeline scheduled these tasks to get the highest priority items done as soon as feasible, but not in strict priority   390 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSIONorder. Each day''s work had to leave the Telescope and the payload bay in a condition that, should the worst emergency arise, the crew could release the Telescope quickly, close the payload bay doors, and head home.  On December 2 at 04:27 EST, following a one-day delay for weather,  finally roared away from the Kennedy Space Center in an uneventful launch. After nearly two days of catching up with Hubble, and periodically firing thrusters to slow down the catchup rate, Pilot Ken Bowersox reported the most-often used words to describe the Telescope: \"Houston, it''s  big!\" Claude Nicollier grappled the Telescope, and gingerly berthed it into the Flight Support Station where the shuttle''s power would substitute for that from the solar arrays. The tiltable turntable would be used to orient the Telescope work areas so that Nicollier and Bowersox, operating the robot arm from the aft flight deck, would have the appropriate portions of the Telescope facing them. On flight day four, December 4 at 10:46 p.m. EST, \"the odd couple\" of Musgrave and Hoffman began the first spacewalk. For five days one or another pair would exit the airlock at around the same time each evening and spend between six and eight hours in the payload bay. This was the real test of all their training, as Musgrave put it: \"I like the heat of the kitchen; I live in it, I''ve lived in it for decades, and I thrive on it. And so, it gets me up-to where I''ve got to be. Goin'' out the door for the first time, I was incredibly interested,  about, have we nailed it in terms of our imaginative process, are the simulators right, are the mockups right, did we approach this job right?\" After setting up the work site, Musgrave and Hoffman replaced the gyroscope packages inside the aft shroud of the Telescope, and gyroscope electronics and fuses in the modular bays around the \"waist\" of the spacecraft. They ran into some problems closing the aft shroud doors, but other-wise all went according to plan. \", Houston; not to get you spun up, but we''ve got six good gyros on the telescope,\" Capsule communicator Greg Harbaugh punned to the crew after the aliveness test spun the new gyros up to operating speed. On flight day five, Akers and Thornton removed the solar arrays. One array had refused to roll up into its cassette, a situation that had been the subject of one of the simulations.   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 391Working during orbital night, when the array would not be generating electricity, Thornton removed the huge and cumbersome wing, holding it while Nicollier moved her into position with the robot arm. At sunrise, as Thornton let go and precisely spread her arms to ten and two o''clock, the array stood rock-steady for a moment, and as thrusters fired  began to back away from the shiny gold \"bird.\" It rotated slowly, and then as a thruster plume hit the array it bent as if a bird or a pterodactyl flapping its wings. The replacement solar arrays went on without a hitch. On flight day six, Musgrave and Hoffman removed the Wide Field/Planetary Camera, stationed it temporarily on a fixture, and prepared to install the replacement. Musgrave likened it to moving a baby grand piano, holding it by the keyboard, and trying to insert it into a gigantic dresser like a drawer. At the far end, however, to be inserted right into the heart of the Telescope just behind the primary mirror, was the camera''s all-important \" pickoff mirror.\" Musgrave had to remove the protective mirror cover, at which time the optics would be exposed. \"That is the most powerful camera in the world, it sees the furthest out there in space and time, if you touch that mirror, however you touch it, that will be on every single image that comes down from the world''s most powerful camera.\" The camera went in without incident, and Musgrave and Hoffman moved to the very top of the Telescope to install new magnetometers. On flight day seven, mission control played the traditional wake-up music, appropriately the popular song, \"I can see clearly, now.\" Working in the aft shroud, Akers and Thornton removed the High Speed Photometer and then installed COSTAR. Crocker got a message from a friend shortly after COSTAR was installed, \"Congratulations ... there''s a train leaving Baltimore tomorrow night at 8:30; if this thing doesn''t work, be under it.\" All they could tell from the aliveness test was that the instrument was ready, but the mirror arms would not be deployed until several days after the servicing mission. In one of the equipment bays, they installed the 386 coprocessor to augment the flight computer''s failing memory. Initially the new coprocessor seemed not to work, providing one of the very few serious problems in the mission. Planners considered adding another spacewalk to remove the new coprocessor and simply replace the entire computer, but it turned out that the problem was on the ground in processing the telemetry. Flight day eight began with a boost from Endeavour''s engines to get the ensemble to the highest orbit possible, 320 nautical miles. The last scheduled spacewalk was challenging, for it involved mostly equipment that had not been designed to be replaced or repaired. Musgrave and Hoffman installed a special cable to restore the power supply in the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph, replaced insulation on the magnetometers, and replaced the electronics box for controlling the solar arrays. When the rolled up solar arrays did not extend, the crew had to crank them out manually. After that, the blankets extended from their cassettes normally.  On flight day nine, December 9 at 11:43 p.m. EST, the Telescope was transferred to its own internal power. At 5:27 the next morning, Nicollier released the spacecraft and the   392 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSIONshuttle slowly backed away. While the controllers at Goddard began the carefully-orchestrated sequence of reactivating the various Telescope systems, the crew enjoyed a day off, and then prepared the shuttle for return. They landed at the Kennedy Space Center on December 13 at 25 minutes past midnight. The most remarkable thing about the mission was that nearly everything had gone according to plan. The few glitches that had occurred were minor, and relatively easily solved.  magazine, in a relatively brief post-mission article, simply referred its readers to the preview published the preceding month, since things had gone so well. The telemetry signs were encouraging, but it was a tense Christmas season while everyone waited to see whether the new instruments would really work as well as they seemed to be functioning. \"It''s fixed beyond our wildest expectations,\" Program Scientist Ed Weiler beamed at a mid-January press conference. Barely five weeks after the servicing mission, after numerous engineering checks, the Telescope had exercised both the new Wide Field-Planetary Camera and COSTAR with the Faint Object Camera. Jim Crocker said the performance was \"as perfect as engineering can achieve and the laws of physics will allow.\"  The newly repaired Telescope \"overshadowed everything else at the American Astronomical Society (AAS) Meeting\" in January 1994. The astronomical end-users of the technology were delighted. Eventually even skeptics had to admit that the Telescope was making good on its most extravagant claims. The dramatic images released only hinted at what was to come. Over the following months, as the rest of the mirror-arms of COSTAR were deployed and the various instruments focused and calibrated, the Telescope really got down to work. In May astronomers announced the first generally convincing evidence for the existence of black holes, an object at the center of the nearby galaxy M-87 with a mass two-three billion times that of our Sun compressed into the size of our solar system. This led the  to editorialize that the \"trials and tribulations\" of the Hubble Space Telescope were, in the end, \"worthwhile .\"  In June, a team led by former Space Telescope Program Scientist Bob O''Dell announced that they had obtained images of protoplanetary disks around young stars in the Orion Nebula, and found the process of planetary formation going on around 56 of the 110 stars observed. These rotating disks of gas and dust had been inferred from other orbiting observatories'' data and in one case even imaged, but not in the detail or in the numbers reported from Hubble.   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE TO BIG SCIENCE 393In mid-July the fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hit Jupiter, and Hubble was ready. Day after day, for more than a week, images of the giant planet from Hubble showed the comet fragments as they went in, and the dusky spots where they had disturbed the giant planet''s atmosphere. In October, the astronomers were startled and the public bewildered by the first results from one of the projects that had been of prime importance since conception of the Telescope. Observations seemed to suggest an age for the universe of eight to twelve billion years, dramatically downward from the fifteen to eighteen billion years previously estimated. Paradoxically, this age was younger than some estimates of the ages of certain stars. By November, confidence in the Telescope''s abilities was so high that its  to find stellar objects was considered a major discovery. For decades astronomers and cosmologists had been increasingly uneasy about the so-called \"missing mass,\" some 90 percent of the matter expected to be in the universe that nevertheless does not show up in surveys. When two separate teams using Hubble Space Telescope observations failed to see anywhere near the expected number of red dwarf stars or other objects in certain fields, it deepened the mystery. The number of conventional places to look for the \"missing mass\" was dwindling, forcing theorists toward more exotic locales . In December, three teams using the Telescope revealed that they had obtained images of galaxies from very early in the universe, perhaps only one tenth of the total time elapsed since the big bang. Surprisingly, the primeval galaxies were found to be of a variety of complex shapes rather than uniformly simple, clustered rather than evenly distributed, and to harbor apparently very old stars. At such an early age of the universe, they had expected to see more uniformity and less structure, and were somewhat at a loss to understand how so much evolution could have taken place in such a short time. These and many other results flowed in a steady stream from the teams using the Hubble Space Telescope. Satisfied customers? Ecstatically so. The telescope carried a lot of baggage. But even if one takes into consideration the various ways in which the performance of the repaired telescope fell short of its original planned performance, it still was enormously useful. It had graduated from making-do to normal operations. The political success of the mission can be read in who decided to appear on the dais at the press conference announcing the first corrected images from Hubble on January 13. Headquarters Acting Associate Administrator for Public Affairs Jeffrey Vincent, in a classic Freudian Slip, welcomed everyone to the \"Goddard Space Flight Senator-ah, Center.\" He had good reason to be nervous. Instead of scientists and engineers, the first panel to speak included Administrator Dan Goldin, White House Science Adviser John Gibbons, and Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), head of the Senate Appropriations Committee in charge of NASA''s budget and in whose district was Goddard, as well as the   394 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSIONSpace Telescope Science Institute. Goldin kept breaking a grin throughout his wide-ranging introduction that praised the servicing mission and likened it to great missions of exploration throughout history. Gibbons, referring erroneously to the formerly \"astigmatic\" Telescope, took the occasion to praise the vision of the Clinton-Gore administration as well. The remarks of all were rhetorical, ceremonial, political, and tinged with minor scientific and technical errors. Senator Mikulski got right to the point: \"I chair the subcommittee that financed the manufacture of the most significant contact lens in American history, the fix on the Hubble Space Telescope, and then bankrolled this extraordinary space HMO that went out and gave Hubble Telescope a new contact lens, and I am happy to announce today, that after its launch now in 1990 and some of its earlier disappointments, [raising her voice] the trouble with Hubble is over!\" Suddenly, she became a scientific briefer as she proudly held up two images taken by the Faint Object Camera before and after COSTAR and explained in detail how much better the performance was. \"This shows what COSTAR can do, and, Mr. Goldin, I''m going to ask you to hold that, because there''s more to come,\" drawing laughter from the assembled reporters as she turned the NASA Administrator into her chartholder. Holding up an earlier Wide Field/Planetary Camera image, she said it \"looks like the way you would look at a road map New Year''s eve,\" and then pointed out the much clearer image from the camera''s successor. \"I believe these pictures are tangible evidence that not only has Hubble been fixed, but NASA is well on its way to fix that culture that created some of these problems ... this was a high stakes repair for Hubble. . . . \" The success can also be read in what happened to the people who led the mission. Of the Collier awardees, two managers went on to significant positions in the Space Station program, the most important effort of the agency since it represented the future. Randy Brinkley became Space Station Program Manager at Johnson, and Milt Heflin began working on integrating extravehicular activity in the Space Station assembly. Brewster Shaw continued to lead Space Shuttle activities at Johnson. Joe Rothenberg eventually became Director of Goddard. The flight crew members went on a long public relations tour that took them to the White House, Congress, Europe, the hottest late-night talk shows, and even an appearance in an episode of ABC''s hit comedy series ''Home Improvement.'' There they played a bit of tape from one of the spacewalks that included two of the male astronauts in the cargo bay of the shuttle doing the primitive grunt popularized by Tim \"The Tool Man\" Allen. As Story Musgrave reflected, \". . . it was something so basic and primitive about it, humans and their tools, and the drama of whether it was all going to get done.\" Commander Richard Covey retired from NASA and joined Unisys Space Systems to head their simulation and training activity. Shortly after the mission he said, \"This would be a great mission to end my astronaut career on, and it would be hard for me as a commander to look to another one that would bring as much reward and joy. . . .\" Characteristically, the rest of the astronauts returned from their publicity tours to move on to the next assignment. Characteristically, when asked about their roles in the mission they would praise the team, and point to somebody else as responsible for the success. The experience and lessons learned from the mission were carried far and wide by the many people who worked on it, and it became a paradigm for emulation. Brinkley, as he moved to head the Space Station planning, deliberately sought out the people and expertise from the Hubble Servicing Mission to incorporate them into Space Station. Even 18   FROM ENGINEERING SCIENCE To BIG SCIENCE 395months later, on June 25, 1995, after the first docking of the shuttle with the Russian space station, , Will Trafton, NASA Headquarters Space Station Director said: \"We''re estimating now some six hundred plus hours,\" [of spacewalks; to assemble the Space Station, with the Russians doing an additional 200 hours.] \"We look at EVA as a resource ... it''s not just another way for a bad event to happen. Hubble has taught us a lot, we''re using the Hubble crew and the Hubble experiences to look at the EVA work that''s required to assemble space station, and we''re pretty happy about where we are.\" From the Hubble servicing mission came confidence that more than a hundred days of Hubble-type work could be done in assembling the station. The Hubble Space Telescope, amid the many mundane reasons for its existence, represented at least in part a transcendent and pure purpose: to explore and try to understand the deepest mysteries of the cosmos. It was also in serious trouble, yet not so serious it could not be saved. NASA, an agency that also represents, at least in part, transcendent and lofty goals, was also in trouble, and its fate tied to that of the Telescope. This brought out the best in people, in the samaritans who extended themselves far beyond their job descriptions to come to the aid of the machine and the idea. They worked long hours, pushed themselves, studied, became innovative and clever. They even were able to forget for a time business, Headquarters, Center, and divisional boundaries, and turf, a remarkable achievement in such institutions, Because people believed in the worth of the mission, and because they also feared in their very bones that failure would bring the most dire of consequences, they gave the mission attention and resources. From Congress and the White House all the way down to small divisions and work groups, they put in money, time, and attention. The anxiety of executives looking over their shoulders might have made more work for the executors, but that anxiety also gave them clout to override ordinary bureaucratic barriers. Amid all the other missions, tasks, and priorities swirling about, they put this one on top for a while. Thus the Hubble servicing mission represents the kind of infrequent and special kind of push that people and organizations do from time to time. \"Not since Apollo,\" was a phrase that many people used to describe how they felt working on this mission. Like Apollo, or the Olympics, however, such a special conjunction of will, spirit, and effort probably cannot be sustained in the ordinary course of things. It was, quite literally, an achievement of focus. Like Apollo too, however successful the mission, it could not by itself create a rising tide for NASA. \"That''s a lot of baggage to carry with you,\" Covey said in answer to a question at the post-mission press conference, \"we had a task to do, and that was to fix the Hubble, . . . and we knew that the best thing we could do was to do that job very well.... and that was all we were thinking about during the course of the mission.... We hope that someone else is able to translate that into NASA doing well.\" Significant historical movements were afoot that were not controllable, indeed, hardly predictable.  warned, shortly after the mission: \"in political and public relations terms, Mission 61 probably presented more risks than ''up-side'' potential. Failure could have been disasterous. But few space policy insiders expect success to give NASA a big, lasting ''bounce''.\"  Even while truly spectacular results were flowing in from the Telescope, and the Clinton administration reaffirmed its faith in the Space Station, the   396 THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSIONNASA budget was in trouble. As an agency, NASA had been selected by the administration to be a showcase for \"reinventing government,\" and from the White House came directive after directive to reduce its budget. Later in 1994, as a new Republican majority was elected to Congress, even more pressure was brought to bear on NASA. Many of the congressional representatives who had been friends to the agency and who had been impressed by the Hubble servicing mission found themselves in the minority party, having been replaced by other representatives who were either hostile or indifferent. Most ironically, the space science budgets were squeezed ever more tightly, Hubble''s included. Scientists feared that the very mission that saved their observatory had lent credibility to the Space Station, which threatened to devour it. Had the mission not been attempted, the Hubble Space Telescope would have been a constant, orbiting reminder of failure, even while producing very good science. With the successful repair came redemption-but only redemption. The agency''s credibility, in this and many other areas, was saved but not boosted. Hubble was no longer an albatross around the neck of NASA, and it appeared the agency could indeed do what it said it would do. But what the public, the politicians, and others  NASA to do remained as it has for most of the history of the agency: uncertain, fickle, and contested.   "

Occasional pH readings of well below 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) have been reported in industrialized areas. The principal natural phenomena that contribute acid-producing gases to the atmosphere are emissions from volcanoes and from biological processes that occur on the land, in wetlands, and in the oceans. The effects of acidic deposits have been detected in glacial ice thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe. Principal human sources are industrial and power-generating plants and transportation vehicles. The gases may be carried hundreds of miles in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. Since the industrial revolution, emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere have increased. Industrial and energy-generating facilities that burn fossil fuels, primarily coal, are the principal sources of increased sulfur oxides. These sources, plus the transportation sector, are the major originators of increased nitrogen oxides. The problem of acid rain not only has increased with population and industrial growth, it has become more widespread. The use of tall smokestacks to reduce local pollution has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation. The same remote glaciers that provide evidence of natural variability in acidic deposition show, in their more recently formed layers, the increased deposition caused by human activity during the past half century.                     In the context of remote sensing, algorithms generally specify how to determine higher-level data products from lower-level source data. For example, algorithms prescribe how atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles are determined from a set of radiation observations originally sensed by satellite sounding instruments.                      The angular distance of an Earth satellite (or planet) from its perigee (or perihelion) as seen from the center of the Earth (sun). Troposphere stems from the Greek word tropos, which means turning or mixing. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth''s atmosphere, extending to a height of 8-15 km, depending on latitude. This region, constantly in motion, is the most dense layer of the atmosphere and the region that essentially contains all of Earth''s weather. Molecules of nitrogen and oxygen compose the bulk of the troposphere. The tropopause marks the limit of the troposphere and the beginning of the stratosphere. The temperature above the tropopause increases slowly with height up to about 50 km. The stratosphere and stratopause stretch above the troposphere to a height of 50 km. It is a region of intense interactions among radiative, dynamical, and chemical processes, in which horizontal mixing of gaseous components proceeds much more rapidly that vertical mixing. The stratosphere is warmer than the upper troposphere, primarily because of a stratospheric ozone layer that absorbs solar ultraviolet energy.  The mesosphere, 50 to 80 km above the Earth, has diminished ozone concentration and radiative cooling becomes relatively more important. The temperature begins to decline again (as it does in the troposphere) with altitude. Temperatures in the upper mesosphere fall to -70 degrees to -140 degrees Celsius, depending upon latitude and season. Millions of meteors burn up daily in the mesosphere as a result of collisions with some of the billions of gas particles contained in that layer. The collisions create enough heat to burn the falling objects long before they reach the ground. The stratosphere and mesosphere are referred to as the middle atmosphere. The mesopause, at an altitude of about 80 km, separates the mesosphere from the thermosphere--the outermost layer of the Earth''s atmosphere. The thermosphere, from the Greek thermo for heat, begins about 80 km above the Earth. At these high altitudes, the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to molecular mass. Thermospheric temperatures increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic solar radiation by the small amount of residual oxygen still present. Temperatures can rise to 2,000 degrees C. Radiation causes the scattered air particles in this layer to become charged electrically, enabling radio waves to bounce off and be received beyond the horizon. At the exosphere, beginning at 500 to 1,000 km above the Earth''s surface, the atmosphere blends into space. The few particles of gas here can reach 4,500 degrees F (2,500 degrees C) during the day.                      29.92 inches or 760 mm of mercury 1013.25 millibars (mb) or 101,325 pascals (pa).                      In radiometry, a relatively narrow region of the electromagnetic spectrum to which a remote sensor responds; a multispectral sensor makes measurements in a number of spectral bands. In spectroscopy, spectral regions where atmospheric gases absorb (and emit) radiation, e.g., the 15 µm carbon dioxide absorption band, the 6.3 µm water vapor absorption band, and the 9.6 µm ozone absorption band.                                             See also:                       CFCs'' ability to destroy stratospheric ozone through catalytic cycles is contributing to the depletion of ozone worldwide. Because CFCs are such stable molecules, they do not react easily with other chemicals in the lower atmosphere. One of the few forces that can break up CFC molecules is ultraviolet radiation, however the ozone layer protects the CFCs from ultraviolet radiation in the lower atmosphere. CFC molecules are then able to migrate intact into the stratosphere, where the molecules are bombarded by ultraviolet rays, causing the CFCs to break up and release their chlorine atoms. The released chlorine atoms participate in ozone destruction, with a single atom of chlorine able to destroy ozone molecules over and over again. International attention to CFCs resulted in a meeting of diplomats from around the world in Montreal in 1987. They forged a treaty that called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs. In 1990, diplomats met in London and voted to significantly strengthen the Montreal Protocol by calling for a complete elimination of CFCs by the year 2000.                      Clouds fall into two general categories: sheet-like or layer-looking stratus clouds (stratus means layer) and cumulus clouds (cumulus means piled up). These two cloud types are divided into four more groups that describe the cloud''s altitude. High clouds form above 20,000 feet in the cold region of the troposphere, and are denoted by the prefix CIRRO or CIRRUS. At this altitude water almost always freezes so clouds are composed of ice crystals. The clouds tend to be wispy, are often transparent, and include cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus. Middle clouds form between 6,500 and 20,000 feet and are denoted by the prefix ALTO. They are made of water droplets and include altostratus and altocumulus. Low clouds are found up to 6,500 feet and include the stratocumulus and nimbostratus clouds. When stratus clouds contact the ground they are called fog. Vertical clouds, such as cumulus, rise far above their bases and can form at many heights. Cumulonimbus clouds, or thunderheads, can start near the ground and soar up to 75,000 feet.                       NASA''s ESE uses space-, aircraft-, and ground-based measurements to provide the scientific basis for understanding global change. The program will produce long-term global maps of clouds, land and ocean vegetation, atmospheric ozone, sea-surface temperature, and other global processes necessary to understand the state of the Earth and to detect any patterns of change. This information will be available to scientists and policy makers through the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). The centerpiece of NASA''s ESE will be the Earth Observing System (EOS), a series of satellites planned for launch beginning in 1999. Measurements from EOS will be complemented by the Earth Probes, a series of discipline-specific satellites and instruments designed to observe Earth processes where smaller platforms and/or different orbits from EOS are required. Planned Earth Probes will measure tropical rainfall, ocean productivity, ozone, and ocean surface winds. In addition, ESE includes current NASA Earth science missions collecting important data on the global environment, such as the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and the Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX/POSEIDON), Space Shuttle experiments such as ATLAS, and aircraft campaigns.                     A cold front occurs when a cold air mass moves into an area occupied by a warmer air mass. Moving at an average speed of about 20 mph, the heavier cold air moves in a wedge shape along the ground. Cold fronts bring lower temperatures and can create narrow bands of violent thunderstorms. In North America, cold fronts form on the eastern edges of high pressure systems.  A warm front occurs when a warm air mass moves into an area occupied by a colder air mass. The warm air is lighter, so it flows up the slope of the cold air below it. Warm fronts usually form on the eastern sides of low pressure systems, create wide areas of clouds and rain, and move at an average speed of 15 mph.  When a cold front follows and then overtakes a warm front (warm fronts move more slowly than cold fronts) lifting the warm air off the ground, an  forms.                      GOES carries the following five major sensor systems:  The Global Change Research Program coordinates and guides the efforts of federal agencies. The program examines such questions as, is the Earth experiencing global warming? Is the depletion of the ozone layer expanding? How do we determine and understand the causes of global climate changes? Are they reversible? What are the implications for human needs and activities?                     Certain gaseous components of the atmosphere, called greenhouse gases, transmit the visible portion of solar radiation but absorb specific spectral bands of thermal radiation emitted by the Earth. The theory is that terrain absorbs radiation, heats up, and emits longer wavelength thermal radiation that is prevented from escaping into space by the blanket of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As a result, the climate warms. Because atmospheric and oceanic circulations play a central role in the climate of the Earth, improving our knowledge about their interaction becomes essential.                     Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have significant natural and human sources while only industries produce chlorofluorocarbons. Water vapor has the largest greenhouse effect, but its concentration in the troposphere is determined within the climate system. Water vapor will increase in response to global warming, which in turn may further enhance global warming.                     From space, hurricanes look like giant pinwheels, their winds circulating around an eye that is between 5 and 25 miles in diameter. The eye remains calm with light winds and often a clear sky. Hurricanes may move as fast as 50 mph, and can become incredibly destructive when they hit land. Although hurricanes lose power rapidly as soon as they leave the ocean, they can cause high waves and tides up to 25 feet above normal. Waves and heavy flooding cause the most deaths during a hurricane. The strongest hurricanes can cause tornadoes.                     *The hair hygrometer uses a human hair as the sensing instrument. The hair lengthens when the air is moist and contracts when the air is dry, but remains unaffected by air temperature. However, the hair hygrometer cannot respond to rapid fluctuations in humidity. *An electric hygrometer uses a plate coated with carbon. Electrical resistance of the carbon coating changes as the moisture content of the air changes--changes that translate into relative humidity. This type of hygrometer is used frequently in the radiosonde. *An infrared hygrometer uses a beam of light containing two separate wave lengths to gauge atmospheric humidity. One of the wavelengths is absorbed by water vapor, the other is unaffected, providing an extremely accurate index of water vapor for paths of a few inches or thousands of feet. See psychrometer.                     The elliptical path of a satellite orbit lies in a plane known as the orbital plane. The orbital plane always goes through the center of the Earth but may be tilted at any angle relative to the equator. Inclination is the angle between the equatorial plane and the orbital plane measured counter-clockwise at the ascending node. A satellite in an orbit that exactly matches the equator has an inclination of 0 degree, whereas one whose orbit crosses the Earth''s poles has an inclination of 90 degrees. Because the angle is measured in a counterclockwise direction, it is quite possible for a satellite to have an inclination of more than 90 degrees. An inclination of 180 degrees would mean the satellite is orbiting the equator, but in the opposite direction of the Earth''s rotation. Some sun-synchronous satellites that maintain the same ground track throughout the year have inclinations of as much as 98 degrees. U.S. scientific satellites that study the sun are placed in orbits closer to the equator, frequently at 28 degrees inclination. Most weather satellites are placed in high-inclination orbits so they can oversee weather conditions worldwide. See orbital inclination.                      The following examples illustrate the use of these prefixes: 0.000,001 meters = 1 micrometer = 1°m 1000 meters = 1 kilometer = 1 km 1,000,000 cycles per second = 1,000,000 hertz = 1 megahertz =1 MHz                     Restructured Federal agency responsibilities for the Landsat program are effective for the acquisition and operation of Landsat 7. New operating policy specifies that NOAA will be responsible for satellites after they are placed in orbit, NASA will be responsible for the development and launch of Landsat 7, and that the U.S. government will provide unenhanced data to users at no cost beyond the cost of fulfilling their data request.                     1.Form of radiant energy that acts upon the retina of the eye, optic nerve, etc., making sight possible. This energy is transmitted at a velocity of about 186,000 miles per second by wavelike or vibrational motion. 2.A form of radiant energy similar to this, but not acting on the normal retina, such as ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Interplay between light rays and the atmosphere cause us to see the sky as blue, and can result in such phenomena as glows, halos, arcs, flashes, and streamers.                      Lightning bolts can heat the air to temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun. This burst of heat makes the air around the bolt expand explosively, producing the sound we hear as thunder. Since light travels a million times faster than sound, we see lightning bolts before we hear their thunderclaps. By counting the seconds between a flash of lightning and the thunderclap and dividing by five, we can determine the approximate number of miles to the lightning stroke.                     The air in a low rotates in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere, and in a clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere. Low-pressure cells are called cyclones.                     The Earth''s magnetic field presents an obstacle to the solar wind, as a rock in a running stream of water. This obstacle is called a bow shock. The bow shock slows down, heats, and compresses the solar wind, which then flows around the rest of Earth''s magnetic field. See Van Allen belts.                     NASA shares responsibility for aviation and space activities with other federal agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, Transportation, and Defense. Much of the work on major projects such as the Space Shuttle and the Space Station is done in the private sector by aerospace companies under government contract.From its inception, NASA has been directed to pursue the expansion of human knowledge of phenomena in the atmosphere and space. NASA''s programs of basic and applied research extend from microscopic sub-atomic particles to galactic astronomy. In addition to enhancing scientific knowledge, thousands of the technologies developed for aerospace have resulted in commercial applications. Science offices at NASA Headquarters carry out a wide range of research activities to fulfill NASA''s science goals.                       NCEP is comprised of nine centers. Each center has a specific responsibility for a portion of the NCEP products and services suite, yet they all work together toward the common goals of saving lives, protecting property, and creating economic opportunity. Seven of the centers provide direct products to users, while two of the centers provide essential support through developing and running complex computer models of the atmosphere.   Weather Service field offices, other government agencies, and private meteorological services rely on NCEP''s products. Many of the forecasts which reach the public via media outlets originate at NCEP. In addition to weather, NCEP meteorologists prepare seasonal forecasts which extend out to a year in advance. See                      The National Weather Service provides weather watch and warning services to the public through 57 Weather Service Forecast Offices (WSFO) and over 100 smaller local Weather Service Offices (WSOs) nationwide. Three national forecasting centers provide general and specialized guidance to WSFOs using computer forecast models, satellite data, and conventional surface and upper air observations from around the world. The centers are: NESDIS provides support to the Weather Service forecast mission by operating a series of environmental satellites and disseminating satellite imagery and derived products to the National Centers and WSFOs. NESDIS operates three national data and information centers: the National Geophysical Data Center, the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC). See SOCC NOAA organizations perform numerous services in addition to monitoring weather conditions. They assess crop growth and other agricultural conditions, sense shifting ocean currents, and measure surface temperatures of oceans and land. They relay data from surface instruments that sense tide conditions, Earth tremors, river levels, and precipitation.                     The NSSDC Master Catalog (NMC) provides an on-line listing of available data sets and the forms that the data are available in (such as CD-ROM), and provides information about the spacecraft and experiments (including past, present, and future NASA and non NASA) from which these data were obtained. The on-line NASA Master Directory (NMD) identifies and briefly describes data of potential interest to the NASA research community, and where possible, provides electronic links to publicly accessible data at sites world-wide.

The force of attraction between two small bodies (or between two spherical bodies of any size) is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. In other words, the closer two bodies are to each other, the greater their mutual attraction. As a result, to stay in orbit, a satellite needs more speed in a low than a high orbit. Kepler''s three laws of planetary motion, which had been derived empirically by Johannes Kepler, were obtained with mathematical rigor as a consequence of Newton''s law of universal gravitation in conjunction with his three laws of motion. See Kepler''s three laws of motion.                     1.Every body continues in a state of uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by some external force. 2.The time rate of change of momentum (mass x velocity) is proportional to the impressed force. In the usual case where the mass does not change, this law can be expressed in the familiar form: force = mass x acceleration or F = ma. 3.To every force or action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction. Kepler''s three laws of planetary motion, which had been derived empirically by Johannes Kepler, were obtained with mathematical rigor as a consequence of Newton''s law of universal gravitation in conjunction with his three laws of motion. See Kepler''s three laws of motion.                     Plant leaves absorb visible light for use in photosynthesis, and they reflect near-infrared light. A light-measuring sensor looking at a healthy plant sees very little reflected visible light and lots of near-infrared light. The more healthy green leaves a plant has, the stronger the difference between the amount of visible and near-infrared light it reflects, and the higher the vegetation index. An unhealthy plant will have fewer green leaves, resulting in a lower score on the vegetation index.A warm occlusion occurs when the coldest air lies ahead of the warm front. Because the cold front can not lift the colder air mass, it rides piggyback up on the warm front over the coldest air.                     Ozone is produced naturally in the middle and upper stratosphere through dissociation of molecular oxygen by sunlight. In the absence of chemical species produced by human activity, a number of competing chemical reactions among naturally occurring species--primarily atomic oxygen, molecular oxygen, and oxides of hydrogen and nitrogen--maintains the proper ozone balance. In the present-day stratosphere, this natural balance has been altered, particularly by the introduction of man-made chlorofluorocarbons. If the ozone decreases, the ultraviolet radiation at the Earth''s surface will increase. See greenhouse gas Tropospheric ozone is a by-product of the photochemical (light-induced) processes associated with air pollution. See photochemical smog. Ozone in the troposphere can damage plants and humans.                     The thinning is focused in the Antarctic because of particular meteorological conditions there. During Austral spring (September and October in the Southern Hemisphere) a belt of stratospheric winds encircles Antarctica essentially isolating the cold stratospheric air there from the warmer air of the middle latitudes. The frigid air permits the formation of ice clouds that facilitate chemical interactions among nitrogen, hydrogen, and chlorine (elevated from CFCs) atoms, the end product of which is the destruction of ozone.                     The amount and distribution of ozone molecules in the stratosphere varies greatly over the globe, changing in response to natural cycles such as seasons, sun cycles, and winds. Utilizing satellites has enabled scientists to assess ozone levels simultaneously over the entire Earth, and has led them to conclude that global ozone levels are being depleted.                     100,000 Pa = 1000 mb = 1 bar. See atmospheric pressure, millibar.                      When ice crystals move within a very cold cloud (10 degrees F and -40 degrees F) and enough water droplets freeze onto the ice crystals, snow will fall from the cloud. If the surface temperature is colder than 32 degrees F, the flakes will land as snow.

NOAA''s National Weather Service (NWS) operates a network of about 90 radiosonde observing sites in the U.S. and its territories. When the balloons burst, radiosondes return to Earth on a parachute. Approximately 25 percent are recovered and returned to NWS for reconditioning and reuse.                     For example, spacecraft in low-Earth orbit pass through the outer thermosphere, enabling direct sampling of chemical species there. These samples have been used extensively to develop an understanding of thermospheric properties. Explorer-17, launched in 1963, was the first satellite to return quantitative measurements of gaseous stratification in the thermosphere. However, the mesosphere and lower layers cannot be probed directly in this way--global observations from space require remote sensing from a spacecraft at an altitude well above the mesopause. The formidable technological challenges of atmospheric remote sensing, many of which are now being overcome, have delayed detailed study of the stratosphere and mesosphere by comparison with thermospheric research advances. Some remote-sensing systems encountered in everyday life include the human eye and brain, and photographic and video cameras.                     Weather satellites commonly carry radiometers, which measure radiation from snow, ice, clouds, and bodies of water. Spaceborne radars are used for Earth observations, bouncing radar waves off land and ocean surfaces to study sea-surface conditions, ice thickness, and land surface features. A wind scatterometer is a special type of radar designed to measure ocean surface winds indirectly by bouncing signals off the water and measuring them from various angles. Infrared (IR) detectors measure heat generated by Earth features in the IR band of the spectrum. Photographic reconnaissance sensors in their simplest form are large telescope-camera systems used to view objects on Earth''s surface. The bigger the lens, the smaller the object that can be detected. Camera-telescope systems now incorporate all sorts of sophisticated electronics to produce better images, but even these systems need cloudless skies, excellent lighting, and good color contrast between objects and their surroundings to detect objects the size of a basketball. Some of the satellites produce film images that must be returned to Earth, but a more convenient method is to record the image as a series of digital code numbers, then reconstruct the image from the electronic code using a computer at a ground station.                     Besides affecting Earth''s weather, solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomena in our atmosphere. The streams of charged particles from the Sun interact with Earth''s own magnetic field like a generator to create current systems with electric potentials of as much as 100,000 volts. Charged electrons are energized by this process, sent along the magnetic field lines towards Earth''s upper atmosphere, excite the gases present in the upper atmosphere, and cause them to emit light which we call the auroras. The auroras are the northern (aurora borealis) and southern (aurora Australis) lights.                     1.The series of colored bands diffracted and arranged in the order of their respective wave lengths by the passage of white light through a prism or other diffracting medium and shading continuously from red (produced by the longest visible wave) to violet (produced by the shortest visible wave). 2.Any of various arrangements of colored bands or lines, together with invisible components at both ends of the spectrum, similarly formed by light from incandescent gases or other sources of radiant energy, which can be studied by a spectrograph. 3.In radio, the range of wave lengths of radio waves, from 3 centimeters to 30,000 meters, or of frequencies of radio waves, from 10 to 10,000,000 kilocycles. Also radio spectrum. 4.The entire range of radiant energies. See electromagnetic spectrum.                     The source of the Sun''s energy is the nuclear reactions that occur in its core. There, at temperatures of 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit) hydrogen atom nuclei, called protons, are fused and become helium atom nuclei. The energy produced through fusion at the core moves outward, first in the form of electromagnetic radiation called photons. Next, energy moves upward in photon heated solar gas--this type of energy transport is called convection. Convective motions within the solar interior generate magnetic fields that emerge at the surface as sunspots and loops of hot gas called prominences. Most solar energy finally escapes from a thin layer of the Sun''s atmosphere called the photosphere--the part of the Sun observable to the naked eye. The sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years and has enough fuel for another 5 billion years or so. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing so large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a ''red giant,'' it will suddenly collapse into a ''white dwarf.'' It may take a trillion years to cool off completely.                     A second generation of ITOS/NOAA* environmental satellites was initiated by the launch of ITOS-1 in 1970, followed by a number of NOAA satellites. The third generation of TIROS-N/NOAA environmental satellites was initiated by the launch of TIROS-N in 1978. * Pairs of acronyms such as ITOS/NOAA arise because NASA funds and names its prototype satellites and then the operating agency funds and names the rest of the series.                     1.The Advanced Very High Resolution Scanning Radiometer (AVHRR) senses clouds over both ocean and land, using the visible and infrared parts of the spectrum. It stores measurements on tape, and later plays them back to NOAA''s command and data acquisition stations. The satellites also broadcast in real time, and the broadcasts can be received around the world by anyone equipped with a direct readout receiving station. 2.The TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) is a 3-part TIROS system to measure: *Temperature profile of the Earth''s atmosphere from the surface to 10 millibars; *Water content of the Earth''s atmosphere; *Total ozone content of the Earth''s atmosphere; 3.The ARGOS Data Collection and Platform Location System  collects data from sensors placed on fixed and moving platforms, including ships, buoys, and weather balloons, and transmits data to a ground station antenna. Because ARGOS also determines the precise location of these moving sensors, it can serve wildlife managers by monitoring and tracking the transmitters placed on birds and animals. 4.The Space Environment Monitor (SEM) measures energetic particles emitted by the sun over essentially the full range of energies and magnetic field variations in the Earth''s near-space environment. Readings made by these instruments are invaluable in measuring the sun''s radiation activity. 5.Search and Rescue Tracking  equipment receives emergency signals from persons in distress. The satellites transmit the signals to ground receiving stations. The signals then are forwarded to rescue coordination centers. The rescue centers compute the location of the signals and provide the coordinates of the emergency site (usually within a few miles). 6.Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a radiometer, flown on NOAA 9 and 10, designed to measure all radiation striking and leaving the Earth. This enables scientists to measure the loss or gain of terrestrial energy to space. Shifts in this energy ''budget'' affect the Earth''s average temperatures. Even slight changes can affect climatic patterns.                     • Study ocean circulation and its interaction with the atmosphere to understand climate change better; • Improve our knowledge of heat transport in the ocean; • Model global ocean tides; • Study the marine gravity field; • Calculate sea-level variations on both global and local scales.                      Because of its longevity, TOMS also has obtained information on the more subtle trends in ozone outside the ozone hole region. This results from development of a powerful new calibration technique that removes the instrument measurement drift that developed over the years. With this technique applied to the TOMS 14.5-year data record, a global ozone decrease of 2.69 percent per decade was detected. To ensure that ozone data will be available through the next decade, NASA will continue the TOMS program using U.S. and foreign launches. In 1991, the former Soviet Union launched a Meteor-3 satellite carrying a TOMS instrument provided by NASA. A third TOMS will be launched onboard a NASA Earth probe satellite in 1994, and the Japanese Advanced Earth Observations Satellite (ADEOS) will carry a fourth TOMS when it launches in 1996.                     TOGA has four major objectives: *To collect and catalog observations of the tropical atmosphere and ocean; *To assess the evolution of the tropical atmosphere/ocean system in real time; To promote the development of short-term climate-prediction computer models for the tropics; *To study the influence of the tropical atmosphere/ocean system on the climate at higher latitudes.                     The present uncertainty about the quantity and distribution of precipitation, especially in the tropics, prohibits definition of the mass and energy exchange between the tropical ocean and atmosphere. Since the tropical atmosphere and oceans are closely coupled, cloud radiation and rainfall are likely to have significant effects on ocean circulation and marine biomass. TRMM data will play a significant role in global change studies, especially in developing an interdisciplinary understanding of atmospheric circulation, ocean-atmospheric coupling, and tropical biology. TRMM data on tropical clouds, evaporation, and heat transfer will be used to understand the larger scale coupling of the atmosphere to oceans.                     When a storm develops a clearly recognizable pattern, it is referred to as a tropical depression. When wind speeds reach 35 knots (40.3 mph), it is called a tropical storm and is given a name. When wind speed equals or exceeds 74 mph, the storm is called a hurricane. In the western Pacific, a hurricane is referred to as a typhoon. In waters around Australia it is called a cyclone or willy-willy. Hurricanes intensify when moving over areas of increased water temperatures, and weaken over colder water surfaces. Upper atmosphere wind shear (different wind direction and speeds at different elevations) will frequently prevent or slow intensification of tropical storms by ''spreading out'' the storm horizontally and preventing the formation of strong updrafts of warm, humid air. Movement over a land-mass will weaken hurricane winds but will result in large-scale rain that can result in large-scale flooding. When encountering a strong frontal system (such as a polar front) the hurricane will curve and track along the leading edge of the front or become implanted in it. Satellite infrared imagery can identify surface water temperatures that will foster tropical storm development.                     Most ultraviolet radiation is blocked by Earth''s atmosphere, but some solar ultraviolet penetrates and aids in plant photosynthesis and helps produce vitamin D in humans. Too much ultraviolet radiation can burn the skin, cause skin cancer and cataracts, and damage vegetation.                     1.In electricity, a periodic variation of an electric current or voltage. 2.In physics, any of the series of advancing impulses set up by a vibration, pulsation, or disturbance in air or some other medium, as in the transmission of heat, light, sound, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      "
