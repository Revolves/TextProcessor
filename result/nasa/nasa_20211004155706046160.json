As of November 19, 2018, Cal Fire reported that the fire was 94 percent contained and had burned almost 97,000 acres (393 square kilometers, or 152 square miles).One day earlier, the  (ASTER) on NASA’s  satellite acquired this view of the burn scar. The colors in this  infrared image (bands 3, 2, 1) have been enhanced to simulate a more natural appearance. Burned vegetation appears brown and unburned vegetation appears green. Buildings, roads, and other developed areas appear light gray and white.Other NASA satellite data have contributed to  for this area, which help fire managers plan for recovery across the burned area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Fire season in the Western United States stretches from late spring until the winter rains arrive at the end of the calendar year. Climate change has made the past few years warmer and drier, intensifying some natural fire cycles.This false-color image shows the brick-red burn scar left behind by the Guiberson Fire in Ventura County, California, on September 26, 2009.

The event knocked out power to nearly 1.5 million customers.From space, the effects appeared dramatic. The  (VIIRS) on the  satellite captured these nighttime images of Puerto Rico before and after the outage. The upper image was acquired at 2:50 a.m. local time (06:50 Universal Time) on September 21, 2016; the lower image shows the island at 2:31 a.m. local time (06:31 Universal Time) on September 22, 2016.Both images were captured by the VIIRS  which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe signals such as gas flares, city lights, and reflected moonlight. Note that the brightness of the ocean surface varies between the images due to slightly different angles of moonlight on the water. Use the slider tool to compare the images.The widespread loss of electricity appears across Puerto Rico in all areas outside of the San Juan metropolitan area. Ponce, Humacao, Aguadilla, Arecibo, and Mayagüez all had large numbers of customers losing power.The fire occurred at the  in Salinas after a power switch overheated. This caused a 2,000-gallon (8,000 liter) mineral oil tank to explode and trigger a fire across a 3-acre (1 hectare) area. According to news reports, the collapse of the power system has caused widespread losses of water and air conditioning, traffic jams, and business and school closures.“With something of this scale, we’re not just seeing an outage. We are seeing a complete stoppage in the rhythms of daily life,” said , a scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and member of the .“These nighttime satellite images help bring a level of situational awareness so we can clearly identify the extent of the impacts into key lifelines of a city’s infrastructure,” added David Green, the program manager for . “We hope that power, civil, and health authorities can use imagery and data like this to map the extent of affected areas and prioritize their personnel and resources to restore critical infrastructure.”                                                      Image of the Day for September 23, 2016                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hurricane Matthew knocked out power for more than one million customers as it grazed the coasts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.

        "content": "August 19, 2019With the fire season in the Amazon approaching its midpoint, scientists using NASA satellites to track fire activity have confirmed an increase in the number and intensity of fires in the Brazilian Amazon in 2019, making it the most active fire year in that region since 2010.Fire activity in the Amazon varies considerably from year-to-year and month-to-month, driven by changes in economic conditions and climate. August 2019 stands out because it has brought a noticeable increase in large, intense, and persistent fires burning along major roads in the central Brazilian Amazon, explained , chief of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. While drought has played a large role in exacerbating fires in the past, the timing and location of fire detections early in the 2019 dry season are more consistent with land clearing than with regional drought.“Satellites are often the first to detect fires burning in remote regions of the Amazon,” Morton said. NASA’s primary tool for fire detections since 2002 has been the  (MODIS) instruments on the  and  satellites.At this point in the fire season, MODIS active fire detections in 2019 are higher across the Brazilian Amazon than in any year since 2010. The state of Amazonas is on track for record fire activity in 2019.Morton noted that 2019 fire activity statistics distributed by NASA and Brazil’s  (INPE) are in agreement. “INPE also uses active fire data from NASA’s MODIS sensors to monitor fire activity in the Brazilian Amazon,” Morton said. “As a result, NASA and INPE have the same estimates of changes in recent fire activity. MODIS detections are higher in 2019 than at this time last year in all seven states that comprise the Brazilian Amazon.”MODIS fire detections are analyzed by the  (GFED) project, which includes Morton and colleagues from NASA Goddard, the University of California, Irvine, and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Over the years, the GFED team has processed 17 years of NASA satellite data to better understand the role of fire for changes in the Earth system. Their analysis of the southern Amazon includes parts of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia that typically see fires between July and October. Their data plots are . January 1, 2012 - August 21, 2019January 1, 2012 - August 21, 2019These plots show cumulative active fire detections from MODIS and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi NPP through August 22, 2019. The data confirm that 2019 is the highest fire year since 2012 (the start of the VIIRS record) across the seven states that comprise the Brazilian Amazon. In addition, fires in 2019 are more intense than previous years, as measured in terms of cumulative .January 1, 2012 - August 21, 2019January 1, 2012 - August 21, 2019On August 19, 2019, the MODIS instrument on NASA’s  satellite captured a natural-color image (top of the page) that shows fires burning in the vicinity of Novo Progresso in the Brazilian state of Pará. The town is located along BR-163, a straight north-south highway that connects farmers in the southern Amazon with an ocean-going port on the Amazon river in Santarém. Pasture and croplands are clustered around the highway in ordered, rectangular plots. To the west of the highway, winding roads connect a series of small-scale mines that extend deep into the rainforest. August 15 -  22, 2019The map above shows active fire detections in Brazil as observed by Terra and Aqua MODIS between August 15-22, 2019. The locations of the fires, shown in orange, have been overlain on nighttime imagery acquired by VIIRS. In these data, cities and towns appear white; forested areas appear black; and tropical savannas and woodland (known in Brazil as Cerrado) appear gray. Note that fire detections in the Brazilian states of Pará and Amazonas are concentrated in bands along the highways BR-163 and BR-230.Since 2003, MODIS sensors on NASA’s Aqua and Terra satellites have made daily observations of thermal anomalies (usually fires) around the world. The fire detection map on this page is based on data from the  (FIRMS), a product developed by the University of Maryland and NASA’s Applied Sciences Program. FIRMS provides near-real-time fire information to natural resource managers and researchers. Note that each point on the map does not necessarily correspond to one fire on the ground. Active fire detections represent the center of a 1 square kilometer area with one or more thermal anomalies. Sometimes one continuous fire can be recorded as multiple anomalies arranged in a line, representing a fire front.Image of the Day for August 26, 2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Fire activity in the Amazon and much of South America often coincides with a dry season from July through October.

Since the authors did not give much background about the images, here is a quick rundown of how they were created and how they fit with some of the key points on our changing climate. Found in : Our Globally Changing Climate  Three hurricanes — Katia, Irma, and Jose — marching across the Atlantic Ocean on September 6, 2017. The frequency of the most intense hurricanes is projected to increase in the Atlantic and the eastern North Pacific. Sea level rise will increase the frequency and extent of extreme flooding associated with coastal storms, such as hurricanes. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi NPP satellite collected the data. Earth Observatory staff combined several scenes, taken at different times, to create this composite. Original source of the image:  Found in : Physical Drivers of Climate Change  Clouds swirl over sea ice, glaciers, and green vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere, as seen on a spring day from an angle of 70 degrees North, 60 degrees East. Over the past 50 years, near-surface air temperatures across Alaska and the Arctic have increased at a rate more than twice as fast as the global average. It is very likely that human activities have contributed to observed Arctic warming, sea ice loss, glacier mass loss, and a decline in snow extent in the Northern Hemisphere. Ocean scientist Norman Kuring of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center pieced together this composite based on 15 satellite passes made by Suomi NPP on May 26, 2012. The spacecraft circles the Earth from pole to pole, so it took multiple passes to gather enough data to show an entire hemisphere without gaps. Original source of the image:  Found in : Detection and Attribution of Climate Change   Columbia Glacier in Alaska, one of the most rapidly changing glaciers in the world. The collective ice mass of all Arctic glaciers has decreased every year since 1984, with significant losses in Alaska. NASA Earth Observatory visualizers made this false-color image based on data collected in 1986 by the Thematic Mapper on Landsat 5. The image combines shortwave-infrared, near-infrared, and green portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. With this combination, snow and ice appears bright cyan, vegetation is green, clouds are white or light orange, and open water is dark blue.

Climate feedbacks are the largest source of uncertainty in quantifying climate sensitivity — that is, how much global temperatures will change in response to the addition of more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite captured this natural-color image on January 4, 2012.

There is uncertainty about future changes in winter extratropical cyclones. Activity is projected to change in complex ways, with increases in some regions and seasons and decreases in others. There has been a trend toward earlier snowmelt and a decrease in snowstorm frequency on the southern margins of snowy areas. Winter storm tracks have shifted northward since 1950 over the Northern Hemisphere.

The human effect on droughts is complicated. There is little evidence for a human influence on precipitation deficits, but a lot of evidence for a human fingerprint on surface soil moisture deficits — starting with increased evapotranspiration caused by higher temperatures. Decreases in surface soil moisture over most of the United States are likely as the climate warms. Assuming no change to current water resources management, chronic hydrological drought is increasingly possible by the end of the 21st century. Changes in drought frequency or intensity will also play an important role in the strength and frequency of dust storms.

Original source of the image:  Found in : Precipitation Change in the United States  Sediment-rich flood water lingering on the Missouri River in July 2011. Detectable changes in flood frequency have occurred in parts of the United States, with a mix of increases and decreases in different regions. Extreme precipitation, one of the controlling factors in flood statistics, is observed to have generally increased and is projected to continue to do. However, scientists have not yet established a significant connection between increased river flooding and human-induced climate change. The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) on NASA’s Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite captured the data for this natural-color image. NASA Earth Observatory staff processed, cropped, and labeled the image.

However, other factors related to climate change — such as water scarcity or insect infestations — may act to stifle future forest fire activity by reducing growth or otherwise killing trees.The MODIS Rapid Response Team made this image based on data collected by NASA’s Aqua satellite. Original source of the image: Found in : Changes in Land Cover and Terrestrial Biogeochemistry   The Grand Canyon in northern Arizona.The southwestern United States is projected to experience significant decreases in surface water availability, leading to runoff decreases in California, Nevada, Texas, and the Colorado River headwaters, even in the near term. Several studies focused on the Colorado River basin showed that annual runoff reductions in a warmer western U.S. climate occur through a combination of evapotranspiration increases and precipitation decreases, with the overall reduction in river flow exacerbated by human demands on the water supply. On July 14, 2011, the ASTER sensor on NASA’s Terra spacecraft collected the data used in this 3D image.

The ice melts for at least 15 more days each year. Arctic-wide ice loss is expected to continue through the 21st century, very likely resulting in nearly sea ice-free late summers by the 2040s.Earth Observatory staff used data from several MODIS passes from NASA’s Aqua satellite to make this mosaic. All of the data were collected on June 28, 2010.

An iceberg the size of Delaware broke off from the ice shelf in 2017. Floating ice shelves around Antarctica are losing mass at an accelerating rate. Mass loss from floating ice shelves does not directly affect global mean sea level — because that ice is already in the water — but it does lead to the faster flow of land ice into the ocean.

The western Gulf of Mexico and parts of the U.S. Atlantic Coast (south of New York) are currently experiencing significant sea level rise caused by the withdrawal of groundwater and fossil fuels. Continuation of these practices will further amplify sea level rise. The MODIS instrument on NASA’s Aqua satellite captured this natural-color image on November 10, 2009.

However, there is important variability at smaller scales, with some locations actually showing decreases of a few days to as much as one to two weeks. However, plant productivity has not increased, and future consequences of the longer growing season are uncertain.On October 21, 2013, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured a natural-color image of these neighboring ridges.

The frequency and severity of land-falling atmospheric rivers on the U.S. West Coast will increase as a result of increasing evaporation and the higher atmospheric water vapor content that occurs with increasing temperature. Atmospheric rivers are narrow streams of moisture that account for 30 to 40 percent of the typical snow pack and annual precipitation along the Pacific Coast and are associated with severe flooding events. On February 20, 2017, the VIIRS on Suomi NPP captured this natural-color image of conditions over the northeastern Pacific.

Is there a possibility that original report can be obtained either at bookstore, library or Internet? I would appreciate more in depth reading and studying. Thank you. J Cambron It is a proven fact that global warming or climate change is caused by increase in greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere. These greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, prevents heat from escaping causing temperature to rise. While there are numerous articles show the impact of climate change on our ecosystem, there aren’t that articles that deal with how climate change impact our global agriculture and health. According to many scientist, the Earth’s population is expected to increase to 9 billion people by 2050, while expecting global food production to decrease. This means that many of the developing countries will suffer starvation and other issues. Unlike developed countries, who already have some type of agricultural infrastructure to mitigate the effect of climate change, developing countries do not. On top of that, developing countries rely heavily on agriculture for sustainment and livelihood, meaning decrease in food production due to climate change can lead to deterioration of welfare. Another impact of climate change, is the shift in food consumption. Decrease in food production will lead to rise in food prices causing individuals to shift toward buying cheaper foods. Cheaper food tend to contain higher fat and sugar which can lead to higher obesity, malnutrition and nutritional imbalance. Not only can climate change affect individuals health, but also bring rise to new forms of pathogens and disease. For example, Salmonella infections in humans show a positive correlation with temperature. Salmonella bacteria and many other pathogens reproduce in warmer temperature, meaning that there might a rise in Salmonella infections in humans. Also there could be a higher possibility of bacterial infections in humans, because warmer climate could alter the ecosystem causing higher number of pests and disease for crops, increasing use of pesticide.Climate change greatly affects global agriculture as well as individual health and welfare. Climate change is a result of excessive greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. Changing temperature, precipitation, drought, floods and extreme weather are some of the side-effects of climate change. There are numerous research and models that show the impact of climate change on global agriculture and all of them show decrease in food production and deterioration in health and welfare. In order to mitigate these negative effects of climate change, countries must implement counter measures. Since, developing countries will suffer the most from climate change, there must be an international trade policy, regulations, incentive programs to develop agriculture infrastructure as well as real-time applications that warn the farmers of upcoming weather so they can minimize crop damage and crop loss. Excellent summary.  It shows that, while the climate change is visible and generally measurable, we have much to learn. thanks     "

By September 8, when the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer  on NASA’s  satellite acquired this image, sunny skies had returned and more than 500 fires burned in Bolivia, said the government. At the height of the fire emergency, the government had reported nearly 40,000 fires.On September 8, the fires were concentrated in the state of Santa Cruz, shown in this image. Fires are outlined in red. The majority of the fires burn outside the dark green rainforest either on the edge of the forest or on brown land that had previously been cleared. These fires were probably started deliberately, since fire is a common land management practice in the Amazon basin. However, the largest of the fires burns in the heart of the Vida Silvestre Rios Blanco y Negro Reserve. Several fires also burn in the nearby Noel Kempff National Park. These fires may not be deliberate.The fire emergency developed in Bolivia because of extreme drought. The lack of moisture meant that even Bolivia’s rainforests were vulnerable to fire in 2010. Fires set to clear land easily burned out of control in the dry conditions.In addition to burning millions of hectares of land, the fires veiled most of Bolivia in smoke. The poor air quality is evident in the large image, which shows smoke over most of northern Bolivia and widespread fires and smoke in Brazil.The large image is the highest-resolution version of the image.

News agencies reported that the entire town of Tonimbuk was wiped out by fire. Few fatalities have been reported in the state, as government agencies ordered evacuations.The fires came particularly late in the season for Victoria, though they were not surprising. Months of  and long-term drought have parched much of the landscape and primed the vegetation for burning.The  (MODIS) on NASA’s  satellite acquired a natural-color image of smoke over Victoria on March 7, 2019.  reported 18 fires were still burning in the state that day, despite two days of rain and cooler weather.The natural-color images below were acquired within a span of four hours on March 3, 2019. The first image comes from the MODIS instrument NASA’s  satellite; the second from the  (VIIRS) on ; and the third from Aqua MODIS. The trio appears to show the formation of bright, tall pyrocumulus clouds.

Pyrocumulus clouds form when heat from a fire forces air to rise quickly, which leads to cooling at high altitude and  of water vapor into clouds. Under certain circumstances, pyrocumuli can produce full-fledged thunderstorms, making them  clouds.Image of the Day for March 8, 2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Baked by heat and drought, deluged by rain and floods, scorched by wildfire, and blanketed in dust, Australia and New Zealand faced several months of extreme weather in 2018-19.With the peak of fire season and a heatwave approaching, Victoria, Australia is bracing for more bush fires such as the two shown in this image from January 28.

The maps are a milestone in the use of satellite data for creating a long-term fire record that is crucial for understanding the impact of fire on life and climate.Using daily, global fire detection provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s  satellite, scientists at Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland have been mapping fire activity for the entire surface of the Earth every day since February 2000. Never before have scientists had the opportunity to map fire across the entire Earth with such detail, accuracy, and frequency.Christopher Justice, of the Department of Geography at University of Maryland, is the project’s lead scientist. He says, “Fire plays a central role in the Earth System. It impacts plant and animal habitat, air and water quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and human lives. MODIS’ fire detection capabilities are a big step forward in satellite-based fire mapping. MODIS can detect fires across the entire Earth more accurately than any previous satellite sensor, and it has a higher temperature threshold, which means it can tell the temperature of even very hot fires.” The near-daily global coverage gives scientists an excellent opportunity to study global fire behavior.The MODIS maps demonstrate the extreme fire seasons seen this year in the US, Australia, and Siberia. The maps also demonstrate fire behavior that would surprise most people, highlighting the contrast between fire size and intensity and frequency. Across the United States, large, intense fires in Western forests attract a lot of attention, but it is the smaller, more numerous fires in the Southeast that dominate the maps. Across the world, the widespread fires that burn each year in the savannas of Africa, Australia, and Brazil dwarf even the most significant fire season in the western United States as far as total acreage and number of fires.The image above shows fires during August 1522, 2002. The greatest  concentrations of fires are in the Amazon, Southern Africa, and Eastern Europe. In addition, there is a dense concentration of fires in Siberia.For more information, read  and visit the                      Image of the Day for August 30, 2002                                                                                                                                   The satellite-based atlas includes information about more than 13 million fires.

        "content": "May 2005 - May 2016El Niño conditions in 2015 and early 2016 altered rainfall patterns around the world. In the Amazon basin, El Niño reduced rainfall during the wet season, leaving the region drier at the start of the 2016 dry season than any year since 2002.“Severe drought conditions at the start of the dry season have set the stage for extreme fire risk in 2016 across the southern Amazon,” said Doug Morton, an Earth scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and a co-creator of the fire forecast. The wildfire risk for July to October now exceeds the fire risk in 2005 and 2010—drought years when wildfires burned large swaths of the rainforest. The  analyzes the relationship between certain climate observations and active fire detections from NASA satellites to predict fire season severity. Developed in 2011 by scientists at the University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine) and NASA, the forecast model is focused particularly on the link between sea surface temperatures and fire activity. Warmer sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific (as observed during an El Niño) and Atlantic oceans shift rainfall away from the Amazon region, increasing the risk of fire during dry months.The forecast team also tracks changes in water storage during the dry season. The maps above show the accumulated deficit in the rainfall input to surface and underground water storage in 2016 and other recent drought years, as reported by the  The accumulated deficit is measured from August through May; for example, August 2015 to May 2016 sets the stage for the 2016 dry season. Shades of red depict areas where rainfall has been below normal, while blues were above normal. ( to learn more about how GRACE studies water supplies.)For 2016, El Niño-driven conditions are far drier than in 2005 and 2010—the last years when the region experienced drought. The prediction team has developed a web tool to track the evolution of the fire season in near-real time  Estimated fire emissions from each region are updated daily based on active fire detections—made by the  (MODIS) instrument on NASA’s Terra satellite—and data from previous years in the Global Fire Emissions Database. So far, the region has seen more fires through June 2016 than in previous years, another indicator of a potentially tough season.“When trees have less moisture to draw upon at the beginning of the dry season, they become more vulnerable to fire and evaporate less water into the atmosphere,” said UC-Irvine scientist Jim Randerson, who collaborated with UC-Irvine scientist Yang Chen on building the forecast model. “This puts millions of trees under stress and lowers humidity across the region, allowing fires to grow bigger than they normally would.”NASA and UC-Irvine scientists have worked in recent years with South American officials and scientists to make them aware of the forecast. Liana Anderson, a from Brazil’s National Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters, said “fire forecasts three to six months before peak fire activity are important to identify areas with higher fire probability for integrated planning.”The fire forecast team is also working to improve wildfire forecasts in other regions of the world. The scientists recently identified nine regions outside the Amazon where fire season risk could be forecast three- to six months ahead of peak fire activity. Randerson said it may be possible to build seasonal fire forecasts for much of Central America and for many countries in Southeast Asia.Image of the Day for July 5, 2016                                                                                                                                                                                Satellites have detected an increase in fire activity early in the 2019 dry season in the southern Amazon.

        "content": "September 12, 2019Fire season in the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales got off to an early and ugly start in September 2019. Fueled by a long and deepening drought, more than 100 fires burned in forest and bush areas near the southeast coasts, including some subtropical rainforests and eucalyptus forests that do not often see fire.The Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Center reported in late August that the 2019-20 fire season—which usually peaks in October near the coast and later in the spring and summer inland—has the potential to be quite active. Conditions all year have been quite warm and dry across much of the nation. With some areas already facing water shortages, and with strong winds fanning the flames, firefighting has been difficult.On September 12, 2019, the  (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite acquired the natural-color image (above) of fires in the northeastern reaches of New South Wales. Strong westerly winds fanned the flames and carried smoke more than 100 kilometers (60 miles).September 5 -  7, 2019The map above shows soil moisture anomalies, or how much the water content near the land surface was above or below the norm as of September 5-7, 2019. The measurements are derived from data collected by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, a NASA satellite dedicated to measuring the water content of soils. SMAP’s radiometer can detect water in the top 5 centimeters (2 inches) of the ground. Scientists use that surface layer data in a hydrologic model to estimate how much water is present even deeper in the root zone, which is important for agriculture.According to the  (BOM), “August rainfall was below average over much of New South Wales, southern Queensland, northern and eastern Victoria, South Australia, and northern Tasmania,” and conditions are not expected to improve anytime soon. Drier than normal conditions have persisted since the beginning of 2017 and, according to BOM, the past 32 months have been the driest on record for New South Wales—34 percent below average.Image of the Day for September 14, 2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Drought and extreme heat primed much of the continent for unusually extreme fire activity, which was then followed by dangerous flooding.Fire managers warned of “the most dangerous bushfire week this nation has ever seen.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                After two years of severe drought, abundant rain finally fell over the Australian state and turned the landscape green.

        "content": "Different satellites provide observation and measurement capabilities for monitoring different fire characteristics: areas that are dry and susceptible to wildfire outbreak, actively flaming and smoldering fires, burned area, and smoke and trace gas emissions. Several satellite systems are currently available for fire monitoring with different capabilities in terms of spatial resolution, sensitivity, spectral bands, and times and frequencies of overpasses.  Fires vary widely in size, duration, temperature, and in the tropics, where it is moist and humid, fires have a strong diurnal cycle. No one system provides optimal characteristics for fire monitoringmulti-sensor data fusion is needed to optimize the use of current systems.  Flown on  NOAA Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites, the  measures electromagnetic radiation (light reflected and heat emitted) from our planet. AVHRR was originally intended only as a meteorological satellite system but it does have applications for fire monitoring. AVHRR remotely senses cloud cover and sea surface temperature, enabling its visible and infrared detectors to observe trends in vegetation, clouds, shorelines, lakes, snow and ice. The visible bands can detect smoke plumes from fires as well as burn scars. The thermal infrared band can detect actual hotspots and active fires. Its ability to detect fires is greater at night, since the  system can confuse active fires with heated ground surfaces, such as beach  sand and asphalt.  Active fire mapping on a global scale using a single satellite system has been coordinated by the International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) using AVHRR data for 1992-93 from international ground stations.    In addition, a small number of countries have developed their own regional AVHRR satellite fire monitoring systems using direct read-out; e.g., Brazil, Russia, and Senegal. Research groups have provided regional examples of trace gas and particulate emissions from fires for Brazil, Southern Africa, Alaska.  The   house a five-channel (one visible, four infrared) imaging radiometer designed to sense radiant and solar reflected energy from sample areas of the Earth. They are stationed in orbits that remain fixed over one spot on the equator, providing continuous coverage of one hemisphere. GOES satellites aquire images every 1530 minutes, at up to 1km resolution in visible light, for the detection of smoke, and 4km resolution in thermal infrared to directly detect the heat of fires.  The   series of Earth-observing satellites monitor characteristics and changes on the surface of the Earth at high resolution (up to 15m  per pixel). The original missions (1970s  early 1980s) used the Multispectral Scanner (MSS) which was only capable of detecting scars. Current Landsat series satellites use the  Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) to provide land surface information. The seven bands (eight on Landsat 7''s ETM+) monitor different types of Earth resources over a wide area (81 North and 81 South Latitude). The thermal band enables the system to detect \"hotspots.\" Landsat 7 provides impressive high-resolution  images but only infrequently, revisiting an area every 14 days.  The   is a measuring device that provides data regarding ozone levels. Measured in Dobson Units (DU), TOMS produces a complete data set of daily ozone levels around the world. This instrument is the first to show aerosols (airborne dust and  smoke particles) over land. It also provides the ability to distinguish aerosols that absorb light from aerosols that reflect it. TOMS makes 35 measurements every 8 seconds, each covering 50-200 kilometers wide on the ground. Close to 200,000 daily measurements cover almost every spot on the Earth except for areas near the poles. These data make it possible to observe a variety  of Earth events including forest fires, dust storms and biomass burning.    The   carries a high-resolution sensor similar to AVHRR, called the Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS),  which is capable of spotting active fires as well as evidence of burn scars.  It has five bands from visible to thermal infrared (.6312µm) and  provides 2km resolution. TRMM''s primary purpose is to measure rainfall over both land and oceans from 30° South to 30° North Latitude. TRMM is unique in that previous satellites tended to show the tops of clouds whereas TRMM instrumentation allows a look into the cloud itself. In addition to its other sensors, TRMM carries LIS, the Lightning  Imaging Sensor. LIS provides information on both cloud to cloud and cloud  to ground lightning strikes around the world. The imager is capable of locating and detecting ninety percent of lightning strikes in the world. This information can help identify areas that may be particularly susceptible to wildfire outbreaks.  In late 1999, NASA launches the first in a series of new Earth remote sensors that will bring dramatically improved capabilities for global monitoring of fires. The Earth Observing System''s flagship spacecraftTerra (formerly named EOS AM-1)will carry a payload of five sensors that, collectively, greatly expand scientists'' capacity for near-real-time fire monitoring, while more accurately measuring emission products. The Terra spacecraft will fly in a near-polar orbit, crossing the equator in the morning when cloud cover is at a minimum and its view of the surface is least obstructed. Subsequently, in 2000, the Aqua (formerly EOS PM-1) spacecraft will launch into a near-polar orbit crossing the equator in the afternoon, to observe the daily variability of surface features.                 This fire occured in Laguna Beach, CA, near Los Angeles,  on November 2, 1993. It was observed by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR),  flown on NOAA''s polar orbiting weather satellites, which can detect the heat from fires in thermal infrared wavelengths, and can image smoke in visible and near infrared bands. (Image by Robert Simmon,  NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, based on NOAA data)  In May, June, and July, 1998, several fires burned out of control on the east coast of  Florida. This image is from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, GOES-8.  Like AVHRR, the instruments aboard NOAA''s geostationary weather satellites detect fires and smoke in visible, near infrared, and thermal infrared wavelengths. Because the orbits of  GOES satellites are synchronized with the Earth''s rotation, they continuously view portions  of the Earth''s surface. (Image by Dennis Chesters, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,  based on NOAA data)  The pink and yellow areas in this image are the remnants of fires - burn scars. This  image was Landsat series satellites only pass over an area once every 14 days, so they are used  to map the effects of fires, rather than their occurence and progress. (For more information  about this image, see: Mapping Landcover and Fire Extent with Satellite Data.)  (Image courtesy Dave Knapp)  Particulates contained in smoke (aerosols) are difficult to measure from satellites,  but recently NASA scientists used Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data to chart the spread of smoke from large fire outbreaks, such as those in Western Brazil  during August, 1998. (Image by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center TOMS project)  In the spring of 1998 drought conditions led to the spread of wildfires throughout  Southeast Asia. The Island of Borneo was especially hard hit. This image from TRMM''s  Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) shows fires (red) and smoke (mixed with clouds) from  March 1, 1998.

        "content": "August 8, 2021As soon as the snow began melting in May 2021, fires  in the  (Yakutia) in eastern Russia. Over the spring and summer, blazes have proliferated and intensified. By August, fires had consumed large swaths of the region’s larch forests. Plumes of smoke blanketed skies, turning , closing airports, and prompting talk of an  in the city of Yakutsk.The  (MODIS) on NASA’s  satellite acquired this natural-color image of large clouds of smoke spreading over Sakha on August 8, 2021. Plumes of this size and opacity have been common for weeks, leading to poor air quality for many of the 280,000 people who live in the nearby city of Yakutsk.  A few days before the image was captured, Russia''s aerial fire protection service  in Sakha. More than 2,600 people and 380 pieces of equipment were fighting fires at that time.In an area as large and remote as Sakha, satellites offer one of the best options for monitoring wildfire activity and tracking the severity of seasonal fire outbreaks. According to Mark Parrington, a scientist with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, the 2021 Sakha wildfires  for estimated carbon emissions for the period from June 1 to August 1. Parrington monitors fires for the  (CAMS) using a satellite-based data record that began in 2003.Counted together with major fires in North America, Africa, and Europe, the Sakha fires helped push global wildfires emissions to record levels in July 2021, . CAMS estimates near-real-time wildfire emissions from its  (GFAS), which aggregates observations of fires acquired by NASA’s Aqua and Terra satellites.“Based on current official burned area reports, Sakha is on track to have an extreme year of fire, but it won’t surpass previous extreme years if the fires are extinguished by the end of August,” said earth scientist Jessica McCarty of Miami University (Ohio). “If large fire events continue into September and October, we could see burned area totals .” Vast areas of Yakutia have burned in the past 20 years, according to . About half of the fires in the region are caused by lightning.  estimated that people start about one-third of Sakha’s fires with discarded cigarettes, sparks from vehicles, negligence with campfires, and arson. Other common causes include power line failures, crop fires, and logging. in Sakha indicate that the total number of fires has declined in recent decades even as the area burned has increased. The trend is likely driven by changes in where people live and in how forests have been managed. Many people in the region moved from small settlements in the countryside into larger towns and cities, and fires are often allowed to burn in rural areas. Closer to cities, fires are typically extinguished.Climate change is likely playing a role in how fire seasons in Sakha are changing. “There have always been large fires in Siberia. It is a landscape evolved to burn,” said McCarty. “What is different because of climate change is that fires are burning larger areas, affecting places farther to the north, and consuming fuels that would have been more fire resistant in the past.”Image of the Day for August 10, 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Whether sparked by lightning, intentional land-clearing, or human-caused accidents, wildfires are burning longer and more often in some northern latitudes as the world warms.An analysis of 35 years of meteorological data shows how fire seasons have changed around the world.

        "content": "Fires  play an important role in the natural changes that occur in Earth''s ecosystems. The diversity of plant and animal life in the world''s forests, prairies, and wetlands is (partly) dependent on the effects of fire; in fact, some plants cannot reproduce without fire (fire breaks open the outside coating of some seeds and stimulates germination). What may at first look like total devastation soon becomes a panorama of new life. Fire initiates critical natural processes by breaking down organic matter into soil nutrients. Rain then moves these nutrients back into the soil providing a rejuvenated fertile seedbed for plants. With less  competition and more sunlight, seedlings grow more quickly.  Wild animals deal with fire remarkably well. Birds fly out of the fire area, large animals leave the danger zone by escaping to ponds and streams, while others return to their burrows. Usually few animals are killed by fire.  Prescribed fire is one of the most important tools used today to manage Earth''s diverse ecosystems. A scientific prescription, prescribed fires help create a mosaic of diverse habitats for plants and animals. If all fire is suppressed, fuel (grasses, needles, leaves, brush, and fallen trees) can build up and allow larger, and sometimes uncontrollable, fires to occur. If enough fuel builds up, the fires could be so intense that they may destroy the seeds in the soil and hinder new tree and plant growth. By burning away accumulated fuels, planned fires make landscapes safer for future natural fires.   By 1990, global tropical deforestation was occurring at a rate of about 1.8 percent of the world''s total forest lands per year. Approximately 142,000 square kilometers of rainforest are eliminated annuallyan area slightly larger than the state of Arkansas (more information on this topic can  be found in the ). Using data from satellite sensors, aircraft, and ground-based initiatives, scientists are working to develop a new global fire monitoring program that will enable them to better understand the myriad implications of this growing problem. Specifically, efforts are underway to quantify the total area of forests and grass land burned each year and to more precisely estimate the amount of resulting emission products. These newer and better data will facilitate development of more robust computer models that will enhance scientists'' abilities to predict how biomass burning will impact climate, the environment, and air quality.                  Burned vegetation quickly releases nutrients back into the soil,  nurturing the rapid growth of new vegetation. These jack pine seedlings germinated after  a fire softened pinecones littering the forest floor, releasing the seeds they held.

It combines natural-color with  to cut through some of the smoke and highlight the active fire fronts. In this view, the hottest and most active parts of the fire are orange-yellow.With wind gusts as high as 40 miles per hour (65 kilometers per hour) that day, the fire quickly advanced across the dry mountain vegetation. It burned through the historic Gold Rush era town of Greenville.Notice that while most of the smoke is being carried toward the north, some smoke hangs in the valleys and canyons south of the active fire areas. Smoke, which can sink toward the ground during a temperature inversion, is especially apparent in the Feather River Canyon.

In this Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) image acquired September 4 over the western coast of the Peloponnesus Peninsula, burned areas appear in dark red, and unburned vegetation is green. The area includes the ancient site of Olympia, the site of the Olympic Games in classical times. The fires came within 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) of the archaeological site, but spared it.With its 14 spectral bands from the visible to the thermal infrared wavelength region, and its high spatial resolution of 15 to 90 meters (about 50 to 300 feet), ASTER images Earth to map and monitor the changing surface of our planet. ASTER is one of five Earth-observing instruments launched December 18, 1999, on NASA''s Terra spacecraft. The instrument was built by Japan''s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. A joint U.S./Japan science team is responsible for validation and calibration of the instrument and the data products. The broad spectral coverage and high spectral resolution of ASTER provides scientists in numerous disciplines with critical information for surface mapping, and monitoring of dynamic conditions and temporal change. Example applications are: monitoring glacial advances and retreats; monitoring potentially active volcanoes; identifying crop stress; determining cloud morphology and physical properties; wetlands evaluation; thermal pollution monitoring; coral reef degradation; surface temperature mapping of soils and geology; and measuring surface heat balance.
