        "content": "AbstractThe Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) spacecraft landed successfully on 26 November 2018 to conduct an exploration of the interior of Mars. To meet NASA’s requirement for communications during critical events, the InSight lander transmitted telemetry continuously throughout entry, descent, and landing. This allowed the public to witness the landing in real time. The transmissions were received by five assets: three at Mars and two on Earth. These included real-time relay of telemetry by the first deep-space CubeSats. This paper describes the constraints on the design of an entry, design, and landing communication link; the uncertainties in the trajectory; and the modeling that was used to meet these constraints. It then reports on the actual performance of each link, including an unexpected degradation of signal to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The lessons learned from this process contributed to the successful relay of data from the Perseverance lander, as well as to the design of future landing communications systems.\r            References\r        [1] Maddock R.

        "content": "AbstractWith technological advances in the 21st century and the rise of the commercial space industry, crewed Mars missions to land humans on our red neighbor have become increasingly feasible. One of the key challenges in accomplishing this goal is determining whether model-based systems engineering training is necessary for space systems engineers to adopt digital engineering. This paper reviews model-based systems engineering benefits and limitations, as well as historically significant crewed Mars missions that planned to land on the surface. Models are presented for a Mars transit habitat developed in the modeling language SysML using Cameo Systems Modeler. These models leverage Cameo’s simulation capabilities to execute MATLAB scripts integrating digital engineering software Systems Tool Kit into the modeling process, demonstrating a reusable interoperability methodology for Mars mission planning not yet existing in this domain’s literature. It can be concluded that integrating model-based systems engineering with digital engineering for crewed Mars landing mission planning can lead to multiple benefits for space systems digital engineering, including 1)greater system simulation capabilities, 2)enhanced model fidelity, and 3)improved system understanding. Future research to further enhance these benefits includes adding cybersecurity considerations and greater system detail to the models.\r            References\r        [1] Douglass B.

This paper presents a suite of motion planning metrics designed for small UAS urban flight and defines map-based and path-based metrics to holistically characterize motion plan quality. Proposed metrics are examined in the context of representative geometric, graph-based, and sampling-based motion planners applied to a multicopter small UAS. A novel multi-objective heuristic is proposed and applied for graph-based and sampling motion planners at four urban UAS flight altitude layers. Monte Carlo case studies in a New York City urban environment illustrate metric map properties and planner performance. Motion plans are evaluated as a function of planning algorithm, location, range, and flight altitude.\r            References\r        [1] LaValle S. M., Planning Algorithms, Cambridge Univ.

        "content": "AbstractOne of the dominating factors in the fatigue of structures made from fiber-reinforced polymers, for example, wind turbine blades, is the polymer matrix. Traditionally, experimental stress–life data of polymers are approximated via a linear double-log Basquin model. Recently, the nonlinear stress–life formulation by Stüssi was found to provide a better fit of the experimental data with a substantially reduced standard deviation. Moreover, a nonlinear constant–life formulation, as proposed by Boerstra, can enhance the representation of the mean stress effect compared with state-of-the-art linear models given by the modified Goodman relation. To this end, Stüssi’s model was incorporated into the Boerstra relation to take account of the mean stress effects of an epoxy. This stress–life formulation was then enhanced with the Weibull probability function. The probabilistic–stress–life model provided a good approximation of the fatigue performance as a function of the stress ratio on the basis of an experimental data set. Finally, a stepwise engineering approach was suggested to derive the permissible stress–life with a view to practical design purposes. The procedure increased the reliability of the fatigue design evaluation compared with the state-of-the-art methodologies.Nomenclatureacoefficientbnegative inverse Stüssi curve exponentccoefficientdcoefficientiexponentMprobability weighted momentmnegative inverse Basquin curve exponentmRstrength gradientNcycles to failurensample size, load cycles, cycles to failurePfailure probabilitypexponentRstress ratioReendurance limitRtstatic tensile strengthTtemperaturexrandom variableαBoerstra exponentβWeibull shape parameterδWeibull scale parameterλWeibull location parameterσnormal stressI. IntroductionThe fatigue performance of fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs) depends on various parameters. For the final failure, the fiber material and its orientation angle with respect to the load axis play a major role [1]. The texture of noncrimp fabrics, for example, especially where fibers and stitching threads cross each other, has an impact on the damage onset and the damage propagation [2]. Moreover, the sizing quality at the interface between the fiber and the polymer matrix [3] affects the fatigue resistance. The matrix itself makes a substantial contribution to the damage onset of an FRP [1], however, particularly when the load axis is transverse to the fiber direction. Besides the matrix’s mechanical performance as a function of the degree of cure [4], its viscoelastic nature (i.e., strain rate dependency, creep behavior, and relaxation behavior [5,6]) and its fracture toughness [7] also have an effect on the fatigue resistance.Epoxy in particular demonstrates a superior performance in terms of strength-to-weight ratio when compared with other polymers such as polyester. Hence epoxy, as either an infusion matrix or a structural adhesive, is a well-established material for wind turbine blades [8].For design purposes, it is essential to accurately describe the mechanical loading of the FRP matrix [9]. The FRP matrix in wind turbine blades is subjected to more than 100 million load cycles during an operational life of at least 20years with various combinations of mean stresses and stress amplitudes that stem from aerodynamic and gravitational loads [10] in addition to the thermal residual stress [4].Krimmer etal. [9] suggested a fatigue design approach for the uni-axial laminate based on the cylinder fiber model with a periodic hexagonal array (CFMh). This approach assumes perfect bonding at the interface between fiber and matrix. Thus, the design analysis of an FRP is conducted on the raw material level, i.e., the isotropic matrix and the fiber. A premature fiber failure in a wind turbine rotor blade can be induced by a matrix failure, also called interfiber failure, cf.[11]. Hence, the fatigue stress exposure of the matrix is typically of interest. Consequently, Krimmer et al.’s approach requires solely the characterization of the matrix. The state-of-the-art procedure, in contrast, requires the characterization of each FRP fabric, cf.[12].Suresh [13] related the damage phenomena to the stress level, which affects the fatigue failure mode of a polymer. Crazes form at high amplitudes and cause microscopic cracks to nucleate in the low-cycle regime. In the time-cycle regime, the failure is dominated by the slow growth of crazes and their conversion into cracks. The high-cycle and very high-cycle regimes form the endurance limit of the polymer the fatigue life being controlled by the incubation time for the nucleation of microscopic flaws. Typically, engineers concentrate on mathematical relations to describe the fatigue life. These relations do not claim to describe the actual physical damage to and the failure behavior of polymers.The stress–life (S-N) performance of a material is usually described by approximating experimental data, a method introduced by Wöhler [14] to investigate the fatigue of alloys used for railroad axles. Nowadays, Basquin’s model [15] is widely used to approximate the stress–life by a linear function in the double-log S-N grid.Mean stress effects play an important role in fatigue of polymers [16] and are usually described by constant–life curves. The most widely used constant–life formulations are those introduced by Gerber [17], Soderberg [18], and Goodman [19]. Of these, the Goodman relation is the one that is most commonly used [20]. Since it has been modified by several authors, it is often called the “modified Goodman” variant. Boerstra [21] suggested a nonlinear constant–life formulation on the basis of Gerber’s formulation. When Basquin’s formulation and the modified Goodman model are combined, the stress–life of a polymer can be described as a function of the stress ratio, cf.[10].The fatigue performance of polymers has turned out to be similar to that of metals in terms of the “sigmoidal” S-N curve shape [22,23], which gives a strong indication for the existence of an endurance limit. Kohout and Vechet [24] proposed a nonlinear stress–life formulation similar to Stüssi’s [25,26] formulation, which cover both the low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue regimes. Recently, Barbosa etal. [27] showed that the nonlinear stress–life approach proposed by Stüssi [25] shows better agreement than Basquin’s model with the experimental data of an FRP [28] in the range from 1 cycle to 10 million cycles. Moreover, Stüssi’s S-N curve fit is more conservative in the low cycle regime between 1 cycle and 1000 cycles.Another significant factor for the reliable stress–life prediction is the description of the stochastic nature by way of so-called probabilistic–stress–life (P-S-N) curves. For the approximation of the strength distribution of FRP materials, normal and Weibull [29] distributions have been taken into consideration in research [27,30] as well as in standards and guidelines [31,32].Castillo and Fernandez-Canteli [33] proposed a probabilistic method for predicting the cycles to failure that was based on a Weibull distribution. Here, both the stress and the number of cycles are used as random variables, cf.[34,35]. Toasa Caiza and Ummenhofer [36] introduced a probabilistic Stüssi function that considers the stress as the sole random variable.Several methods have been proposed for estimating the parameters of the three-parameter Weibull distribution, e.g., graphical approaches, least squares and linear approaches, maximum likelihood approaches, and methods of moments, cf.[33,37]. Hosking etal. [38] suggested estimating the parameters and quantiles by means of the probability weighted moments (PWMs)introduced by Greenwood etal. [39]. They found that the PWM method outperforms the maximum likelihood method in many cases where the shape parameter β<2. Also, Toasa Caiza and Ummenhofer [40] confirmed that the PWM estimates are in good agreement with the S-N data for β>2.Recently, Barbosa etal. [41] suggested the use of constant–life curves based on trained artificial neural network algorithms and probabilistic Stüssi fatigue fields.This work derives a mathematical model on the basis of Stüssi’s S-N relation and Boerstra’s constant–life relation to describe the fatigue performance of an epoxy infusion matrix. The confidence level of the stress–life curve is taken into account using a Weibull distribution. The derived model is validated with experimental data. Moreover, Boerstra’s model is incorporated into Basquin’s model to enhance the representation of the stress ratio and thus the mean stress effects. Finally, the Stüssi–Boerstra model derived is compared with the traditional Basquin–Goodman approach, and one practical approach for the design analysis is derived.II. MethodsA. ExperimentalHexion’s EPIKOTETM resin MGSTM RIMR 035c and EPIKURETM curing agent MGS RIMH 037 (RIMR035c/ H037) [42] were used as the polymer material. Plates of different thickness were manufactured by means of the resin transfer molding (RTM) method with an injection pressure of 3bar. Specimen series were then cut with a water-jet. One set of specimens had a standard dog bone geometry according to [43], and was used for both the static characterization with a stress ratio of R=1.0 and the tension-tension fatigue characterization with a stress ratio of R=0.1 (Fig.1a). Another nonstandard set of specimens had a shorter gauge length than the standard specimen and was designed for greater buckling resistance. This set was used for the alternating fatigue characterization with a stress ratio of R=−1.0 (Fig.1b). These plates were cured at 30°C for 12h and postcured at 80°C for 7h.Static tensile and cyclic tests were conducted on calibrated 25 and 50kN uni-axial servo-hydraulic tension-compression test machines, respectively, each with a class 0.5 load cell according to [44]. The test frequency was kept below 6Hz to prevent a temperature increase caused by hysteretic energy dissipation. The target ambient temperature during the tests was the standard class 1 room temperature of 23°C [45], which was controlled by air-cooling fans. The surface temperature of each specimen was measured with a platinum resistance temperature detector (RTD). Strain gauges of type GFLAB from Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo were installed parallel and transverse to the load axis, one on each side of all the static specimens. The glass transition temperature Tg was measured via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) according to [46].Fig. 1 Photographs of postmortem specimens: a)R=0.1 and b)R=−1.0; crack surfaces of specimen c)no. 14 and d)no.22.A test result is considered to be valid i)when the specimen failed within the gauge length, ii)when no voids were observed within the optically transparent specimen (Figs.1a and 1b) and on the crack surface (Figs.1c and 1d), and iii)when the specimen surface temperature did not increase by more than ΔT=5°C during the fatigue test.The maximum stress σmax, the stress ratio R, the cycles to failure N, the test frequency f, the average surface temperature T with its standard deviation, and the ratio between average specimen surface temperature and glass transition temperature T/Tg of each specimen are summarized in Table1.The experimental results were corrected to exclude effects stemming from the average test temperature and the degree of cure, e.g., mix ratio, exothermicity, or postcuring cycle. On the basis of the hypothesis of a linear relation between the static strength Rt and T/Tg as shown by Fiedler [47], the maximum stress derived from the experiments was corrected with σmaxcor=mR(Td/Tgd−T/Tg)+σmax(1)where superscript d stands for the target design temperature. Therefore, a gradient of mR=−371.3  MPa⋅K⋅K−1 (Fig.2) was used, which was derived from experimental data [47] for a similar polymer material, i.e., Hexion’s EPIKOTE resin MGS RIMR 135 and EPIKURE curing agent MGS RIMH 137 (L135i/H137) [42]. Here, we chose the standard class 1 room temperature [45] of Td=23°C as the design target ambient temperature, and the average glass transition temperature for all specimens cured for an infinitely long time as Tg∞=86.1°C: Td/Tgd=0.824  K⋅K−1.Fig. 2 Static strength as a function of T/Tg.B. Stress–Life Approach and Constant–Life CurveThe most widely used and still state-of-the-art expression for the relationships between amplitude σa and cycles to failure N was suggested by Basquin [15] σa=RtN−1/m(2)where m denotes the negative inverse Basquin curve exponent. On the basis of Stüssi’s formulation [25,26], the nonlinear relationship between σa and N across all regions can be formulated as σa=Rt+Re((N−1)/Na)1/b1+((N−1)/Na)1/b(3)where Re denotes the endurance limit at zero mean stress, and Na stands for the inflection point position on the abscissa when the curve is plotted in the semi-logarithmic grid. Note that we introduced a horizontal shift of the curve such that the intersection with the ordinate is at N=1 (Fig.3a). The detailed derivation of Eq.(3) is given in AppendixA. The negative inverse Stüssi curve exponent b can be expressed by the gradient at the inflection point Na, which is complementary to the negative inverse Basquin curve exponent m with b=m1−Re/Rt2(1+Re/Rt)(4)The detailed derivation of Eq.(4) is given in AppendixB.Fig. 3 Mathematical relation between a)stress–life models and b)constant–life models.The mean stress level σm of the fatigue cycle imposed has an important effect on the fatigue life [16]. Mean stress effects in fatigue can be represented in terms of constant–life curves that combine σa and σm (Fig.3b). The modified Goodman [19] equation describes a linear symmetric constant–life diagram: σa=σaR=−1(1−|σm|Rt)(5)where σaR=−1 denotes the stress amplitude with zero mean stress or with a stress ratio of R=−1. On the basis of the nonlinear symmetric constant–life formulation proposed by Gerber [17], Boerstra [21] formulated a constant–life relation with a variable exponent α: σa=σaR=−1(1−(|σm|Rt)α)(6)The following subsections describe the derivation of models that combine the above S-N and constant–life curves.1. Derivation of Basquin–Goodman ModelThe stress amplitude and mean stress level of a cyclic load are defined as σa=σmax−σmin2(7)and σm=σmax+σmin2(8)respectively. The stress ratio is defined as the ratio between minimum and maximum stress R=σminσmax(9)After solving Eq.(9) for σmin and combining the result with Eqs.(7) and (8), the stress amplitude and mean stress can be expressed as functions of σmax and the stress ratio R as σa=σmax2(1−R)(10)and σm=σmax2(1+R)(11)respectively.To integrate the mean stress effect into the description of the stress–life fatigue performance, Basquin’s linear double-log S-N expression with zero mean stress given in Eq.(2) is inserted as σaR=−1 into the modified Goodman relation [Eq.(5)] to yield σa=(Rt−|σm|)N−1/m(12)cf.[48]. Solving Eq.(12) for the permissible number of cycles N yields the well-known expression N=(Rt−|σm|σa)m(13)Combining Eqs.(10) and (11) with Eq.(12) yields the maximum permissible stress as a function of the tensile strength Rt, the stress ratio R, the corresponding cycle number N, and the negative inverse S-N curve exponent m: σmax=2Rt(1−R)N1/m+|R+1|(14)Solving Eq.(14) for the permissible number of cycles N yields N=(2Rt(1−R)σmax−|1+R|1−R)m(15)2. Derivation of Basquin–Boerstra ModelCombining Basquin’s linear S-N curve with zero mean stress σaR=−1 [Eq.(2)] with Boerstra’s nonlinear constant–life formulation [Eq.(6)], and solving for the permissible number of cycles N yields N=[Rtσa(1−(|σm|Rt)α)]m(16)Combining Eqs.(10) and (11) with Eq.(16) yields N1/m=2Rtσmax(1−R)(1−(|σmax(1+R)|2Rt)α)(17)Equation(17) can be solved numerically for σmax using Brent’s algorithm [49], for example, to find the root with g(σmax)=N1/m−2Rtσmax(1−R)(1−(|σmax(1+R)|2Rt)α)(18)Note that the denominator of g(σmax) has a vertical asymptote at σmax=0.3. Derivation of Stüssi–Boerstra ModelCombining Stüssi’s nonlinear S-N curve with zero mean stress σaR=−1 [Eq.(3)] with Boerstra’s nonlinear constant–life formulation [Eq.(6)], and solving for the permissible number of cycles N yields N=1+Na[−σa−Rt[1−(|σm|/Rt)α]σa−Re[1−(|σm|/Rt)α]]b(19)Combining Eqs.(10) and (11) with Eq.(19) yields (N−1Na)1/b=σmax(R−1)+2Rt{1−[|σmax(1+R)|/(2Rt)]α}σmax(R−1)+2Re{1−[|σmax(1+R)|/(2Rt)]α}(20)Equation(20) has to be solved numerically for σmax using Brent’s algorithm [49] to find the root with g(σmax)=(N−1Na)1/b−σmax(R−1)+2Rt{1−[|σmax(1+R)|/(2Rt)]α}σmax(R−1)+2Re{1−[|σmax(1+R)|/(2Rt)]α}(21)Note that the denominator of g(σmax) has a vertical asymptote. The asymptote and thus the lower boundary for Brent’s algorithm is found by finding the root of the denominator by numerical means with a(σmax)=σmax(R−1)+2Re(1−(|σmax(1+R)|2Rt)α)(22)The upper boundary corresponds to the static strength Rt.4. Derivation of Basquin–Boerstra Tangent ModelThe tangent point (Nt, σmaxt) of two functions is obtained when the derivatives of the two functions are identical, and their values are also identical. The negative inverse S-N exponent mt of the Basquin–Boerstra tangent model is found by equating Eqs.(2) and (3): mt=ln(Nt)ln{[Rt(1+((Nt−1)/Na)1/b)]/[Re((Nt−1)/Na)1/b+Rt]}(23)The partial derivative of Stüssi’s relation [Eq.(3)] is defined as ∂σa∂N=(Re−Rt)((N−1)/Na)1/bb(N−1)[((N−1)/Na)1/b+1]2(24)and the partial derivative of Basquin’s relation [Eq.(2)] is defined as ∂σa∂N=−RtN(−1/mt−1)mt(25)After setting Eq.(24) equal to Eq.(25), the number of cycles Nt at the tangent point is obtained using Eq.(23) by finding the root by numerical means with g(Nt)=RtNt(−1/mt−1)mt+(Re−Rt)((Nt−1)/Na)1/bb(Nt−1)[((Nt−1)/Na)1/b+1]2(26)Since there are two roots for Eq.(26), the number of cycles Na at the inflection point should be used as the lower boundary.C. Stress–Life Curve FitThe Basquin–Goodman model, the Basquin–Boerstra model, and the Stüssi–Boerstra model were fitted to the experimental data. The Nelder–Mead method [50] minimized the objective function f(x,p)=∑in[log10(σmaxicor)−log10(σmax(x,p))]2(27)For the Basquin–Goodman model and the Basquin–Boerstra model, the design variables set x consists of the negative inverse S-N curve exponent m and the tensile strength Rt. For the Stüssi–Boerstra model, the design variables set additionally requires the number of cycles Na at the inflection point, and the endurance limit Re.The parameter set p consists of the data points for each specimen as shown in Table1, i.e., the corrected maximum stress σmaxicor, the cycles to failure Ni, and the stress ratio Ri. The parameter n denotes the number of specimens (sample size) excluding the runouts. σmax denotes the maximum stress according to the respective model: Eq.(14), Eq.(18), or Eq.(21).When the model includes Boerstra’s nonlinear constant–life relation, the first S-N fit is conducted assuming a linear Goodman relation (α=1). Upon completion of the first S-N fit, a constant–life approximation is performed, as described in Sec.II.E. S-N and constant–life fits are conducted iteratively until the convergence of the standard deviation given in Eq.(39).D. Probabilistic Stress–Life CurveThe three-parameter Weibull distribution is considered to enhance the aforementioned S-N models. The cumulative distribution function of a random variable x that follows a Weibull probability distribution [33,37] is given by P=1−exp(−(x−λδ)β)(28)where x≥λ, λ∈R is the location parameter, δ>0 is the scale parameter, and β>0 is the shape parameter. The random variable is defined as per [36] as the difference between the corrected experimental value as per Table1 and the respective model [Eq.(14), Eq.(18), or Eq.(21)]: x=σmaxcor−σmax(29)Solving Eq.(28) for x yields the percentiles x=λ+δ(−ln(1−P))1/β(30)Substituting σmaxcor with the maximum permissible stress σmaxP for a desired failure probability P in Eq.(29), combining with Eq.(30), and solving for σmaxP yields σmaxP=σmax+λ+δ(−ln(1−P))1/β(31)Inserting the maximum stress σmax of a stress–life model, e.g., Eq.(14), Eq.(18), or Eq.(21), into Eq.(31) yields the corresponding probabilistic stress–life curve.The Weibull parameters λ, δ, and β can be estimated by the method of PWMs as given by [39]. Let x1<x2<…<xn be the random variables according to Eq.(29) arranged in ascending order. The estimators of the first three PWMs are then given by M0^=1n∑i=1nxi(32)M1^=1n(n−1)∑i=1n−1(n−i)xi(33)and M1^=1n(n−1)(n−2)∑i=1n−2(n−i)(n−i−1)xi(34)cf.[37,40]. The parameter β is obtained with 3M2−M02M1−M0=3−1/β−12−1/β−1(35)cf.[37,40], which can be solved numerically for β by finding the root using Brent’s algorithm [49] with g(β)=3M2−M02M1−M0−3−1/β−12−1/β−1(36)The parameter δ is obtained with δ=2M1−M0(2−1/β−1)Γ(1+1/β)(37)cf.[37,40]. The parameter λ is obtained with λ=M0−δΓ(1+1/β)(38)cf.[37,40]. The standard deviation of the static strength is obtained with Rts=δ(Γ(1+2/β)−Γ2(1+1/β))1/2(39)cf.[33].E. Constant–Life Curve FitTo fit the constant–life curve, the experimental data points are projected along the S-N curve fit for each cyclic stress ratio R, i.e., R=−1.0 and R=0.1. As the target projection cycle numbers we chose cycle regimes that contain sufficient data, i.e., N=[1,1×103,1×104,1×105,1×106]. For the projection, Eq.(29) determines the stress difference of each data point from the maximum stress value, which is then added to the maximum stress of the desired number of cycles. That is, in the constant–life diagram each cyclic data point is projected along two dimensions: to each stress ratio tested (R=−1.0 and R=0.1) and to each cycle number N mentioned above. The stress amplitude and mean stress are determined with Eqs.(10) and (11), respectively.The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm [51,52] approximates Boerstra’s relation [Eq.(6)] by means of a least-squares fit of the projected experimental data points. The intersection point with the ordinate σaR=−1 and the exponent α are used as the variables. The static strength Rt is obtained from the S-N curve fit [Eq.(27)].Now, α can be plotted over the number of cycles in the semi-logarithmic grid. An Akima spline [53] can provide a flexible approximation of the distribution. A more constrained approximation is offered by an exponential function α=a(N−d−1)+1(40)F. Damage CalculationOnce the fitting parameters of the stress–life models have been found and the Weibull parameters estimated, the models derived can be used to calculate the probabilistic stress–life for a load collective (ni, σmaxi, Ri). This requires a desired failure probability P, e.g., 5%, to be chosen.The permissible cycle number N for the Basquin–Goodman model is obtained by substituting σmax in Eq.(15) with σmaxP as given in Eq.(31) to yield N=(2Rt(1−R)(σmax−λ−δ(−ln(1−P))1/β)−|1+R|1−R)m(41)The permissible cycle number N for the Basquin–Boerstra model is obtained by substituting σmax in Eq.(18) with σmaxP as given in Eq.(31) to yield the stress–life dependence of N with g(N)=N1/m−2Rt(σmax−λ−δ(−ln(1−P))1/β)(1−R)⁢(1−(|(σmax−λ−δ(−ln(1−P))1/β)(1+R)|2Rt)α(N))(42)Usually, α is modeled as a function of the number of cycles N. This means that Eq.(42) must be solved numerically to find the root. The lower boundary corresponds to N=1.The permissible cycle number N for the Stüssi–Boerstra model is obtained by substituting σmax in Eq.(21) with σmaxP as given in Eq.(31) to yield the stress–life dependence of N with g(N)=(N−1Na)1/b−(σmax−λ−δ(−ln(1−P))1/β)(R−1)+2Rt{1−[|(σmax−λ−δ(−ln(1−P))1/β)(1+R)|/(2Rt)]α(N)}(σmax−λ−δ(−ln(1−P))1/β)(R−1)+2Re{1−[|(σmax−λ−δ(−ln(1−P))1/β)(1+R)|/(2Rt)]α(N)}(43)Usually α is modeled as a function of the number of cycles N. This means that Eq.(43) must be solved numerically to find the root. If no vertical asymptote exists for N>1, the lower boundary corresponds to N=1. The asymptote is found by finding the root of the denominator of Eq.(43) in analogy with Eq.(22).The permissible cycle number for the Basquin–Boerstra tangent model is derived from the probabilistic stress–life curve of the Stüssi–Boerstra model by substituting σmax in Eq.(21) with σmaxP as given in Eq.(31). Now, the negative inverse S-N exponent mt is found; see Sec.II.B.4. Next, combining Eq.(18) with Eq.(40) yields the stress–life dependence of N: g(N)=N1/mt−2Rtσmax(1−R)(1−(|σmax(1+R)|2Rt)a(N−d−1)+1)(44)which must be solved numerically to find the root.Assuming that the linear damage accumulation according to Palmgren [54] and Miner [55] applies, the accumulated damage of i effective load collective increments is calculated as D=∑iDi=∑iniNi(45)G. Chosen ProcedureThis section summarizes the steps to be conducted to predict the fatigue life of a polymer: Conduct static (R=1.0) and at least two sets of cyclic (R=−1.0 and R≈0.1) experiments.Correct the maximum stress of each specimen by taking into account the ambient test temperature T, the glass transition temperature Tg, and the respective gradient mR (see Sec.II.A).Fit the Stüssi–Boerstra model to the experimental data (see Secs.II.C–II.F).Estimate the Weibull probability parameters for the Stüssi–Boerstra fit to derive the 5% quantile curve (see Sec.II.E).Derive the Basquin–Boerstra tangent model for Stüssi–Boerstra’s 5% quantile curve (see Sec.II.B.4).Obtain the permissible cycle number Ni for a load collective (ni, σmaxi, Ri) with Eq.(44) to conduct the damage analysis (see Sec.II.F).H. Application ExampleAn application example is made available as part of the MAMO toolbox for material models [56], whose latest code development can be cloned at https://github.com/mrosemeier/mamo. The example uses a calculation workflow to describe how the models derived are applied for a fatigue damage analysis of a wind turbine blade.The Modelica library for Wind Turbines (MoWiT) [57] was used to simulate load time series of the DTU 10MW reference wind turbine, cf.[58]. An Euler–Bernoulli [59] beam model of the blade [60] transformed the bending moment time series into longitudinal strain time series along the trailing-edge suction side laminate. Classical laminated plate theory (CLPT) [61] and Krimmer’s [9] micromechanical CFMh transformed the strain time series into stress time series in the matrix material of each lamina. A rainflow-counting algorithm [62] reduced the stress time series to amplitude-mean matrices, which were then used with the models derived to calculate the damage as described in Sec.II.F.III. ResultsThree models were fitted to the corrected experimental data of Hexion’s EPIKOTE resin MGS RIMR 035c and EPIKURE curing agent MGS RIMH 037 [42]: 1)Basquin–Goodman (shown in Figs.4a and 4b); 2)Basquin–Boerstra (shown in Figs.4c and 4d); 3)Stüssi–Boerstra (shown in Figs.4e and 4f).The fittings simultaneously take into account three stress ratios: R=1.0, R=0.1, and R=−1.0. The corresponding probabilistic-maximum–stress–life (P-S-N) of the aforementioned models are illustrated in Figs.4c and 4e. The respective fatigue constant–life curves are shown in Figs.4b, 4d, and 4f. The Basquin–Goodman model produces a P-S-N curve whose fit is inferior to that of the other two models. The 50% quantile curve for alternating load (R=−1.0) passes below the data points, whereas the curve for tension-tension loading (R=0.1) passes above the data points. Thus, the average of the static R=1.0 data points is underestimated. This is also illustrated by the constant–life curves that pass below the R=−1 and above the R=0.1 projected data points.Fig. 4 Maximum stress–life and constant–life curve fits of corrected experimental data: a,b)Basquin–Goodman; c,d)Basquin–Boerstra; e,f)Stüssi–Boerstra.Implementing Boerstra’s nonlinear constant–life model instead of Goodman’s linear constant–life model enhances the fitting by averaging the test data in both the P-S-N and the constant–life diagrams. However, the Basquin–Boerstra model provides the data points at the lower and upper end of cycles to failure with above average weights, i.e., 2×103<N>4×105), whereas the data points in between have a below average weight.When Stüssi’s nonlinear S-N model is implemented instead of Basquin’s linear double-log S-N model, the average over all stress ratios is in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, unlike the Basquin–Goodman and Basquin–Boerstra models, the Stüssi–Boerstra model describes an endurance limit Re for each stress ratio.The Stüssi–Boerstra model fits the data points projected to the static strength with the smallest standard deviation Rts and thus generates a Weibull probability distribution that is more slender than that of the other models (Fig.5a). This can also be seen in the vertical distance between the 5 quantile and 95% quantile S-N curves in Fig.4.Figure5b illustrates the 5% quantile S-N curves of the three models. In addition to the experimental stress ratios, it also shows the model prediction for the stress ratio of R=0.5. Considering the stress ratio of R=−1.0, the Basquin–Goodman model predicts a shorter stress–life than the other two models. This is not the case for the stress ratios R=0.1 and R=0.5, however: In the cycle range 4×103<N<2×105…4×105, the Basquin–Goodman and Basquin–Boerstra models are less conservative than the Stüssi–Boerstra model.Fig. 5 Comparison of Basquin–Goodman model (BG), Basquin–Boerstra model (BB), and Stüssi–Boerstra model (SB): a)Weibull probability; b)5% quantile. The three models compared with Basquin–Boerstra tangent model (BBt): c)Boerstra exponent constant–life (CL) fit and interpolation; d)5% quantile.To ensure that the fatigue estimation is always conservative and to keep the computational effort low, we propose an alternative to the Stüssi–Boerstra model: A Basquin–Boerstra model that is tangent to the 5% quantile S-N curve of the Stüssi–Boerstra model (Fig.5d). As described in Sec.II.B.4, the negative inverse S-N slope of the Basquin–Boerstra tangent model is defined by two points, i.e., the static strength Rt and the tangent point (marked by a plus sign) in the high-cycle fatigue (HCF) regime.Where Basquin–Boerstra’s and Stüssi–Boerstra’s models use an Akima spline [53] to model Boerstra’s exponent α, the Basquin–Boerstra tangent model uses an exponential function in the semilogarithmic grid (Fig.5d). The circles and diamonds show the corresponding Boerstra exponent for the fitted constant–life curves shown in Figs.4d and 4f, respectively.IV. DiscussionA. Quality of Experimental DataThe experimental data set given in Table1 is considered to be sound for the evaluation of the fatigue life because no voids were observed within the specimen. Moreover, the average test temperature did not significantly exceed the ambient temperature, i.e., by ΔT=2.4°C at maximum, and the standard deviation of the test temperature was low, i.e., maximum of ΔTs=0.8°C. Both observations imply that the hysteretic energy dissipation can be excluded because of the test frequencies chosen.The experimental data have to be corrected to form a database that is free from effects stemming from the specimen manufacture, the testing, and the environment. To this end, we recommend the fatigue strength of each specimen be corrected for the average specimen temperature T during the test and the glass transition temperature Tg. Moreover, the target T/Tg should be chosen to represent the design operating conditions and the degree of cure conditions of the final product.At least two cyclic data sets with stress ratio of R=−1.0 and R≈0.1 are required to obtain reasonable constant–life approximations. The data points should be equally spread over the desired prediction range of cycles.B. Reliable Modeling of Fatigue LifeWe need to clarify that the models suggested in this work are based solely on the chosen mathematical relations, and we do not claim to describe the actual physical damage and failure behavior of polymers. Where phenomenological models exist, these should be preferred. However, since practical engineering design purposes currently still rely on these mathematical descriptions, we present a practical way of choosing and combining these models to fit experimental data in order to provide a more reliable description of the fatigue behavior of polymers.C. Endurance LimitBasquin’s model assumes a constant reduction of the permissible stress level with increasing number of cycle, thus imposing no endurance limit. The Stüssi fit based on the experimental data used for this work assumes that there is one, however. When taking into consideration the experimental data points, we observe a trend toward an asymptotic approximation in the high-cycle fatigue regime, which can be justified with the well-fitting Stüssi–Boerstra model that reveals the lowest standard deviation. Sufficient data points are not available as yet to reliably predict the stress–life in the very high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime (N>1×106). More experimental data are required to prove the validity of the proposed Stüssi–Boerstra fit. To overcome this uncertainty, we propose fitting the Basquin–Boerstra model, which is tangent to the Stüssi–Boerstra model, for a reliable design evaluation.D. Applicability of ModelsThe state-of-the-art Basquin–Goodman model is the simplest model to implement in the design analysis for the fatigue limit state; i.e., the analytical equations can be solved directly for the desired variable [Eq.(13)]. This work, however, shows that the Basquin–Goodman model does not appropriately represent the experimental data, which is indicated by the large standard deviation and the low average static strength when compared with the two other models applied (Fig.5a).For the prediction of the material fatigue performance, the Stüssi–Boerstra model shows the best agreement with the experimental data, having the lowest standard deviation. When compared with the Basquin–Goodman model, the Stüssi–Boerstra model requires more variables and requires a suitable fit to be found for Boerstra’s exponent (Fig.5c). To reduce the complexity of the Stüssi–Boerstra model, we suggest the Basquin–Boerstra tangent model be implemented. However, numerical methods are required to solve the equations for the desired variable [Eqs.(18) and (44)].V. ConclusionsAn epoxy polymer was systematically tested under static and cyclic loading. To form a unified basis for the data that excludes uncertainties stemming from the manufacture, the testing, and the environment, the experimental data points were corrected by the respective test temperature and glass transition temperature. On this basis, a best-fit engineering approach for the probabilistic stress–life and constant–life was investigated. The derived Stüssi–Boerstra model was found to reliably predict the fatigue life in the high-cycle fatigue regime with the lowest standard deviation. The state-of-the-art Basquin–Goodman model produced a prediction of the fatigue life that was very conservative in part, but also less conservative in other parts.To overcome the lack of conservatism, the uncertainty as to whether an endurance limit exists in the very high-cycle fatigue regime, where there was insufficient experimental data, and to simplify the fatigue strength prediction in the design analysis, an alternative to the state-of-the-art Basquin–Goodman model is proposed: the Basquin–Boerstra model that is tangent to the Stüssi–Boerstra model.Future experimental work should support our assumption of the existence of an endurance limit in the very high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime. Moreover, the shape of the nonlinear constant–life curves at stress ratios of R=±0.5 should be validated experimentally.S. ShinAssociate EditorAppendix A: Derivation of Eq.(3)Stüssi [25,26] formulated the nonlinear stress–life relation in its original form as σa=Rt+cnpRe1+cnp(A1)where c and p denote geometric coefficients. We reformulated Eq.(A1) such that the gradient at the curve’s inflection point equals the gradient of Basquin’s formulation given in Eq.(2); see Fig.3a. Therefore, Stüssi’s curve can be plotted on a linear grid by inserting n=10i(A2)into Eq.(A1), which yields σa=Rt+c10ipRe1+c10ip(A3)The second partial derivative of Eq.(A3) is defined as δσa2δ2i=(1−c10ip)cp210ip(Re−Rt)ln2(10)(1+c10ip)3(A4)The x-coordinate Na of the curve’s inflection point is obtained by finding the root of Eq.(A4) and combining it with Eq.(A2), which yields Na=(1/c)1/p(A5)Consequently, the y-coordinate of the curve’s inflection point is obtained by inserting Eq.(A5) into Eq.(A1), which yields σa(n=Na)=(Re+Rt)/2(A6)Now, the coefficient c in Eq.(A1) can be expressed as the inverse of the cycle number at the inflection point Na by solving Eq.(A5) for c as c=(1/Na)p(A7)The exponent p can be expressed as the negative inverse exponent at the inflection point Na: p=1/b(A8)In addition, the permissible number of cycles is expressed as n=N−1(A9)such that σa(N=1)=Rt in Eq.(A1). Combining Eqs.(A7–A9) with Eq.(A1) yields Eq.(3).Appendix B: Derivation of Eq.(4)The relation between the negative inverse Basquin exponent m and the negative inverse Stüssi exponent b given in Eq.(4) is derived by constructing a linear Basquin curve at the inflection point (Na,(Re+Rt)/2) of Stüssi’s curve. Therefore, Eq.(3) is solved for N as N=Na(σa−RtRe−σa)b+1(B1)The partial derivative of Eq.(B1) is defined as ∂N∂σa=Nab(Re−Rt)((σa−Rt)/(Re−σa))(b−1)(Re−σa)2(B2)The gradient at the inflection point is calculated from Eq.(B2) as ∂N∂σa(σa=Re+Rt2)=4bNaRe−Rt(B3)Moreover, the negative inverse Basquin exponent m of a Basquin-like tangent through the point (Na, (Re+Rt)/2) is expressed as m=−ln(N)−ln(Na)ln(σa)−ln((Re+Rt)/2)(B4)Solving Eq.(B4) for N yields N=Na(2σaRe+Rt)−m(B5)The partial derivative of Eq.(B5) is defined as ∂N∂σa=−mNaσa(2σaRe+Rt)−m(B6)The gradient at the inflection point is calculated with Eq.(B6) as ∂N∂σa(σa=Re+Rt2)=−2mNaRe+Rt(B7)Setting Eq.(B3) equal to Eq.(B7) and solving for b yields Eq.(4).Supplemental MaterialThe data presented in the figures and the table are available in a data repository at 10.5281/zenodo.4732887 [63].

        "content": "AbstractThe influence of the flat-plate leading-edge shape on laminar–turbulent transition is investigated. Experiments were carried out at a Mach number of M∞=5; a unit Reynolds number Re1∞ from 1.5×107 to 9×107  m−1; and a Reynolds number Reb∞, based on the leading-edge thickness b, up to 7×105. Four leading-edge shapes were investigated: cylindrical, elliptical, flat face, and “smoothed” cylindrical. It has been shown that for Reb∞<0.4×105, these shapes practically do not affect transition; whereas at large Reb∞, the laminar run can be lengthened or shortened by the leading-edge shaping. The influence of bluntness thickness on the flow parameters at transition onset is analyzed by solving the Navier–Stokes and boundary-layer equations.\r            References\r        [1] Stetson K.

        "content": "AbstractScanned-direct absorption spectroscopy was implemented to improve sensing capabilities in the mixing volume (MV) of the 60MW Interaction Heating Facility (IHF) at NASA Ames Research Center. The IHF MV conditions range from 5000 to 8000K and 1 to 9atm. The path-average line-of-sight measurements of the temperature and enthalpy were inferred using an electronic atomic oxygen transition near 777nm. A scanned-DAS sensor was optimized to capture high-add-air and high-pressure conditions that previously had not been measurable, including an increased tuning range (3  cm−1) that allowed for full absorbance profile resolution at maximum pressure test conditions. Enhanced sensor capabilities confirmed uniform flow and flat temperature profiles immediately upstream of the arcjet’s converging–diverging nozzle inlet. Less uniform and parabolic temperature profiles were observed immediately downstream of add-air injection. Time-resolved enthalpy measurements ranged from 16 to 27MJ/kg and are in agreement with the IHF’s current measurement methods. Centerline measurements along the MV confirmed a reduction in achievable enthalpy after installation of the MV. The centerline measurements quantified the mixing process for various add-air conditions, indicating an opportunity for enthalpy recapture. Axial locations of sufficient mixing were identified and provide a potential for reduction of the MV length and improved facility performance.\r            References\r        [1] Balter-Peterson A., Nichols F., Mifsud B. and Love W., “Arc Jet Testing in NASA Ames Research Center Thermophysics Facilities,” 4th Symposium on Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization, AIAA Paper  1992-5041, 1992. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.1992-5041 LinkGoogle Scholar[2] Stewart D.

        "content": "AbstractThe response and performance of an aeroelastic hypersonic intake was studied experimentally using fundamental geometry and structural boundary conditions. The experiments were conducted in a hypersonic wind tunnel at a Mach 5.85 condition. The most relevant deforming component was the compression ramp, which was treated as a cantilever surface to emulate the global deformation of the intake. Flowfield measurements were performed using pressure transducers, pressure-sensitive paints, and schlieren flow visualization. The dynamic structural response was measured using digital image correlation as well as feature tracking from the schlieren videos. A point measurement of total pressure in the isolator was taken using a pitot tube to quantify the effects of intake ramp deformation on the intake performance. The loss of total pressure in the isolator was found to correlate directly with the intake ramp deformation, with a direct transient correlation between the peak loss in total pressure recovery and the peak ramp deformation. While undergoing aeroelastic deformation, the total pressure recovery of the cantilever compliant ramp decreased by up to 20% from the baseline values. The analysis showed a strong coupling, along with hysteresis in dynamic response, between the intake structural deformation and the shock-wave/boundary-layer flowfield in the isolator.\r            References\r        [1] Ho S.-Y. and Paull A., “Coupled Thermal, Structural and Vibrational Analysis of a Hypersonic Engine for Flight Test,” Aerospace Science and Technology, Vol.10, No.5, 2006, pp.420–426. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ast.2006.03.004 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[2] Kline H.

        "content": "AbstractThis study investigates the application of an exhaust gas energy harvesting hybrid powertrain to three general aviation aircraft with reciprocating spark-ignition piston engines. The hybridization process involves downsizing the internal combustion engine to save weight and installation of an exhaust heat harvesting system composed of a harvester, a generator, lithium-ion traction battery, an electrical conversion system, and an electric motor. Novel calculations for a hybrid powertrain performance envelope are presented that estimate the upper limits to the degree of downsizing and mass of the harvester. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has been proposed as a potential compact, high-efficiency harvester. Five hydrofluroolefins (which have no ozone depletion potential and very low global warming potential) are considered as organic fluids for the ORC. It is found that R-1336mzz(Z) performs best in this application. Each ORC design parameter is investigated, and an optimized design with 14.3% thermal efficiency is found. At this efficiency, the internal combustion engine may be downsized up to 34.5%. The fuel burn reduction at this degree of downsizing may be as high as 12.7–14.5%.\r            References\r        [1] Shafiee S. and Topal E., “When Will Fossil Fuel Reserves be Diminished?” Energy Policy, Vol.37, No.1, 2009, pp.181–189. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2008.08.016 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[2] Maurice L., “ICAO Goals for Aviation Fuel Burn Reduction from Technology,” ICAO Environmental Rept. 2013,  International Civil Aviation Organisation, 2013.

        "content": "AbstractCurrently, several green propellants are under investigation to replace the toxic and carcinogenic monopropellant hydrazine (N2H4). Beside alternatives as ammonium dinitramide-based propellants, hydroxylammonium nitrate-based mixtures, or high concentrated hydrogen peroxide, mixtures of fuels with nitrous oxide (N2O) called HyNOx or NOFBX represent promising green propellants. Compared to classical N2H4, N2O/fuel mixtures offer a higher performance (Isp and c*), no or low toxicity, and low propellant costs. To investigate the handling and performance of a propellant mixture consisting of N2O and ethene, hot gas combustion tests with an experimental combustor were conducted. This paper summarizes the results of 134 combustion tests conducted with the premixed propellant injected in gaseous state. Calculated and measured performances (c* and ηc*) depending on mixture ratio, characteristic combustion chamber length L*, and chamber pressure are shown and discussed. Furthermore, the residence timescales of the propellant mixture inside the combustion chamber are normalized by the chemical timescale of the combustion process. Thus, combustion efficiencies depending on dimensionless Damköhler numbers are derived.\r            References\r        [1] Sutton G.

        "content": "AbstractIn this study, impact of the port diameter and length changes of a solid fuel on its performance parameters was investigated to propose design considerations for the solid fuel for hydrogen peroxide/high-density polyethylene hybrid rockets. A laboratory-scale hydrogen peroxide/high-density hybrid rocket was designed to perform a parametric study of the solid fuel through experiments. The ratio of the nozzle throat area to the fuel port area and ratio of the fuel length to the fuel port diameter were used to design the port diameter and length of the solid fuel. Altering the fuel port diameter affected the characteristic velocity efficiency, oxidizer mass flux, velocity-based erosive burning, oxidizer-to-fuel ratio, and regression rate. Altering the fuel length affected the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio and characteristic velocity efficiency and had little effect on the regression rate because it did not significantly contribute to the change in the oxidizer mass flux. No improvement was observed in the characteristic velocity efficiency after the ratio of the fuel length to the fuel port diameter reached 20. Finally, design considerations for the port diameter and length of the solid fuel for a hydrogen peroxide/high-density polyethylene hybrid rocket were suggested based on the experimental results considering the changes in the ratio of the nozzle throat area to the fuel port area and ratio of the fuel length to the fuel port diameter.\r            References\r        [1] George P., Krishnan S., Varkey P.

        "content": "AbstractThe effect of thermochemical kinetics modeling on hypersonic flow over a double-cone geometry is investigated. The double-cone is simulated using three different approaches based on the Park model: nonequilibrium flow, equilibrium flow, and frozen flow for air at four different freestream conditions. The thermochemical model effects on the flowfield and surface properties are specific areas of interest. The resulting aerothermodynamic loads are compared to experiments performed in the CUBRC LENS-XX facility and indicate that thermochemistry modeling plays an important role in determining surface properties. The results indicate that the specific thermochemistry model used to describe hypersonic flow over a double-cone significantly affects surface properties for both CUBRC facilities, especially at high enthalpies. A comparison of Park and Modified Marrone–Treanor thermochemistry models is also made, and it is concluded that the models produce similar surface properties, due to the freestream density, and fail to reproduce experimental results. Consistent overprediction of the pressure drag and heating rate indicates there is some unknown fundamental difference between the experiments and the simulations, thus limiting the usefulness of these double-cone experiments for validation of thermochemistry models.\r            References\r        [1] Mehta A., “Hypersonics ‘Highest Technical Priority’ for Pentagon RD Head,” Defense News, March 2018.

        "content": "AbstractSmall, low-thrust, long-burn-time solid propellant rocket motors could provide propulsion for a new class of kilogram-scale, transonic, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper investigates technological challenges of small, low-thrust solid rocket motors: slow-burn solid propellants, motors that have low thrust relative to their size (and thus have low chamber pressure), thermal protection for the motor case, and small nozzles that can withstand long burn times. Slow-burn propellants were developed using ammonium perchlorate and 0–20% oxamide (burn-rate suppressant), with burn rates of 1–4  mm⋅s−1 at 1MPa. Using these propellants, a low-thrust motor successfully operated at a thrust/burn area ratio 10 times less than that of typical solid rocket motors. This kilogram-scale motor can provide 5–10N of thrust for 1–3min. An ablative thermal protection liner was tested in these firings, and a new ceramic-insulated nozzle was demonstrated. This paper shows that small, low-thrust solid motors are feasible and presents a baseline design for the integration of such a motor into a small UAV.\r            References\r        [1] Jane’s All the World’s Aircraft: Unmanned, IHS Markit, London, 2016.

        "content": "AbstractWe conduct a high-speed visualization of coolant liquid film dynamics inside a 10N-class bipropellant thruster using monomethylhydrazine and a mixture of nitrogen tetroxide with approximately 3% nitric oxide as propellants at equivalent conditions with the flight model. The direct visualization of the liquid film inside a quartz glass chamber demonstrates the transient dynamics of film flow from ignition to cutoff for the first time. The scenario for the life of the film flow is found as follows: the coolant fuel jet impinges on the chamber wall being the liquid film; the friction force from the chamber wall rapidly decelerates the film as one-tenth of the injection velocity; next, the film moves sheared by the fast combustion gas downstream; and eventually the film completely evaporates by heat transfer from the hot combustion gas. The liquid film presents the typical ripple wave structure, covered by the velocity and thermal boundary layers. The effect of the mixture ratio is significant as the film flow rate increases at a small mixture ratio, leading to the longer film length.NomenclatureDinner diameter of the chamber, mFCfilm-cooling ratehfilm thickness, mLfilm length, mm˙Ffuel mass flow rate, g/sm˙FCfilm mass flow rate, g/sm˙Ooxidizer mass flow rate, g/sMRoverall mixture ratioMRcoremixture ratio of core flowPcchamber pressure, MPaQvolumetric flow rate, m3/sReffilm Reynolds numberTfilm lifetime, sttime, sTflameadiabatic flame temperature, Kνkinematic viscosity, m2/sVfrontfilm front velocity, m/sVinjfilm injection velocity, m/sVlocallocal film velocity, m/sαthermal diffusivity of film, m2/sεexpansion ratio of the nozzleθcircumferential phase of chamber, radλwavelength of film flow, mρfilm density, kg/m3ταtimescale for temperature boundary layer, sτνtimescale for velocity boundary layer, sI. IntroductionBipropellant thrusters are widely used to control orbit and attitude for geostationary satellite buses that require higher specific impulse and larger thrust unachievable by monopropellant thrusters [1,2]. Combinations of hypergolic fuel and oxidizer, such as hydrazine or monomethylhydrazine (MMH) for fuel and a mixture of nitrogen tetroxide with approximately 3% nitric oxide (MON3) for oxidizer, eliminate complex ignition systems. In the recent and future cargo spacecraft for the International Space Station [3–6] and in planetary exploration missions for descent and ascent modules [7–9], the bipropellant thrusters keep playing an essential role. The bipropellant thrusters use a combustion chamber generally made of ceramic [10] or high-temperature heat-resistant metal, such as niobium alloy [11,12] or one of the precious metals [13,14]. Inside the combustion chamber, the fuel and oxidizer jets ejected from an injector impinge to form a liquid sheet, followed by sheet atomization, mixing, ignition, and combustion, in a sequential fashion. As schematically depicted in Fig.1, the chamber wall must tolerate heat transfer from the hot combustion gas, exceeding 3000K; thus, a film-cooling technique is widely employed by extending a thin liquid film on the chamber inner surface by directly impinging fuel jets and spreading along as a liquid film [15]. The liquid film produced on the chamber wall elongates downstream with evaporation, developing to a certain length at the balancing point between the heat input and the latent heat, reaching a steady state at last. The chamber wall temperature in the area covered by the coolant film can remain at the saturation temperature of liquid film, avoiding direct heat input from the combustion gas. It is important for designing thrusters to retain a sufficient flow rate for the film-cooling fuel and simultaneously to minimize the film flow rate for improving specific impulse. By predicting the film extension length based on a physical understanding of the film flow dynamics, the compatible management of thermal tolerance and performance is strongly demanded.Several past studies have been devoted to liquid film dynamics. Kinney etal. [16] initiatively took snapshots of a liquid film flow in a transparent tube with a cocurrent fast hot gas, presenting the wavy film formation due to strong shear stress by the gas stream. Cherdantsev etal. [17] and Shinan etal. [18] also observed the liquid film flow sheared by a high-velocity gas stream. Inoue and Maeda [19] succeeded in the comprehensive formulation describing the unstable liquid film dynamics. Stechman etal. [20] tried to predict the film length based on heat transfer between the combustion gas and chamber wall. Shine etal. [21] proposed a one-dimensional control volume approach for a fundamental energy-balance concept. There are some semi-empirical correlations for various combinations of propellants such as hydrogen peroxide/kerosene [22] and liquid oxygen (LOX)/liquid hydrogen [23].Fig. 1 Schematics of temperature and coolant liquid film distributions inside a bipropellant thruster.One of the issues that arises is a lack of experimental data for coolant liquid film dynamics under an operating combustion condition inside a practical thruster. Yarygin etal. [24] experimentally measured the film thickness and velocity subjected to a sonic air flow by using capacitance sensors and quantified the amount of droplet entrainment. Knuth [25] conducted experiments using the hot air flow with water as the liquid coolant in a tube. Morrell [26] employed small rocket engines operating with three different coolant films: water, ethyl alcohol, and liquid ammonia. Arnold etal. [27] experimentally measured temperature distribution of a LOX/liquid methane combustor and studied the film-cooling efficiency. These studies, however, focused on the film-cooling flow at the steady states, and there have been limited experimental data available reporting the developing film dynamics before reaching the steady film length. Consequently, as recently emphasized by Shine and Nidhi [28], it is still difficult to accurately predict the film length, attributed to the limited quantitative experimental data especially for the unsteady film dynamics inside a practically operating bipropellant thruster.Therefore, in the present paper, we conduct a high-speed optical measurement inside a quartz glass chamber, quantifying the coolant liquid film dynamics and the film length exposed to the hypergolic combustion gas stream. Based on the experimental results, we investigate the effect of chamber wall, combustion gas, and evaporation on the film flow. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to report the unsteady film dynamics under the same operating conditions as 10N-class practical bipropellant thrusters.II. Experimental MethodFigure2 shows a schematic of the experimental setup. From upstream, there are two tanks for fuel and oxidizer pressurized by helium gas, solenoid valves for the respective paths, and the bipropellant thruster including the propellant valves. Detailed explanations can be found in our previous paper [29].We used the combination of MMH and MON3 for fuel and oxidizer, respectively. Table1 shows their major properties [30,31]. For the coolant film, a higher boiling point and lower vapor pressure are preferable characteristics to be less evaporative and cover the inner wall of the combustion chamber for a longer time. This test campaign uses MMH for the coolant film as usually employed in practical thrusters.Fig. 2 Schematic of the experimental setup [29]. (Reprinted with permission from Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol.36, No.5, 2020, pp.677–684 Copyright©2020 by AIAA, Inc.)Allowing for the direct observation of the film-cooling flow dynamics, the combustion chamber is made from quartz glass, shown in Fig.3a. The chamber is integrally manufactured with the throat and the nozzle. The inner diameter of the chamber is D=10  mm, and the expansion ratio of the nozzle is ε=8. The combustion chamber is mounted horizontally to the injector face plate by the metal holder. The film-cooling flow is visualized using a high-speed camera (Vision Research, Phantom Miro M310) through the open window of the holder from the horizontal direction of θ=0, depicted in Fig.3b. The recording rate is 24,000fps for self-luminous images, and 51,000fps for backlight images. The chamber pressure is measured by a pressure transducer, KYOWA PHL-A-5MP-B, with a sampling rate of 1kHz. The high-speed camera and the pressure transducer are synchronized with the input signal to the propellant valve.The thruster has a single unlike-impinging type injector [29] for the core spray on the central axis of the combustion chamber, and two fuel jets for the film flow on the inner chamber wall. The core fuel and the film-cooling fuel are introduced to the individual injector hole through the same valve and manifold. The timing of coolant film flow and core flow are almost the same due to the same flow velocity calculated by the mass flow rate and the area of each injector hole. The sheet of the core fan is produced on the plane of θ=0. The two injector holes for the coolant film are allocated on the opposite sides at θ=0 and π, respectively. The coolant jet collides with the chamber wall 2mm downstream from the injector plate, spreading along the chamber wall as a liquid film. The opening response time is 2 to 3ms [29], indicating that the film flow is in the stable condition at the last moment of 50ms opening time. We visualize the back side of liquid film spreading in the area of −π/2<θ<π/2 from the injector face plate to the throat.Fig. 3 The quartz glass chamber.Table2 shows the experimental conditions. All the experiments were conducted at sea level with mixture ratios of MR=1.0,1.6, and 2.1 calculated as MR=m˙Om˙F+m˙FC(1)The target chamber pressure was set to approximately 1MPa equivalent with the flight model with the same total flow rate of (m˙O+m˙F+m˙F). The Reynolds number of the combustion gas is 3×105  in turbulent condition, based on the length scale of D and gas properties obtained by the chemical equilibrium analysis [32]. The propellant valve motion controlling the firing mode is set to 50ms for opening time and 950ms for closing time, with a cycle of 1000ms. Three pulses are sequentially repeated for each MR condition. It is shown in [29] that the time history of chamber pressure is almost the same just before cutting off, therefore three pulses provide sufficient samples. In the following, the mean experimental results indicate the averaged values in the three pulses.III. Results and DiscussionTo reveal the coolant liquid film dynamics, we present visualization results of the developing coolant film dynamics and then show quantitative measurement results of the film length, velocity, thickness, and wavelength with changing MR.A. Repeatability EvaluationThe relative difference of averaged chamber pressure during stable combustion among the three pulses is 2.5%; thus, the film flow rate is being reasonably constant in the three pulses at each MR condition. Detailed repeatability of the combustion test is evaluated in [29]. We confirmed that the produced liquid film length in the present experiment was longer than the flight model of the ceramic chamber, because the large heat capacity of the thick quartz glass wall cooled the film. The trend of the film length against MR was consistent between the present glass chamber and the flight model.B. Chamber Pressure and Film ExtensionFigure4 shows time history of the chamber pressure from ignition to cutoff at MR=1.6 and visualization results of the film-cooling flow. In Fig.4a, the valve-opening signal to the propellant valve indicated by the dotted line is applied at t=0  ms, and ignition is detected by the pressure transducer at t=9  ms. The time lag is attributed to the dribble volume upstream of the chamber and to the pressure-sensing delay [29]. The closed circles in Fig.4a indicate the chamber pressure corresponding to the visualization results in Fig.4b. In Fig.4b, the film is visible on the chamber wall in front of the combustion flame. The white circles represent the most extended film front. At t=6.7–8.7  ms, the film rapidly propagates. After that, the film gradually extends to the maximum length at t=42.1  ms, in which the film front completely evaporates by the heat transfer from the combustion gas. At t=42.1  ms, the chamber pressure becomes a steady state. The film front keeps the same position until t=50  ms at valve close. Thus, the film length can reach the steady state in the 50ms firing duration as the chamber pressure and the combustion gas velocity reach constant. Another notable phenomenon is that the film flow extends downward as shown in Fig.4b. The reason is that the chamber is set horizontally, resulting in the film flow being affected by gravity to extend downward.Figure5 shows the detailed film flow being the maximum film length at t=50  ms and MR=1.6. Figure5a shows the self-luminous image. A wavy pattern on the film is clearly confirmed up to the film front. The coolant film fully covers the combustion chamber wall at a circumferential direction of −π<θ<π. Figure5b shows the enlarged impinging region by backlight visualization. A part of the film flows upstream of the collision point, contributing to cooling the area close to the injector face plate. We find the smooth film without the waves near the collision point until 3mm downstream. The following wavy pattern shows the typical ripple wave, also reported by Kinney etal. [16] and Cherdantsev etal. [17] in the past, formed by superposing two types of instabilities; the Kelvin–Hermholtz instability along the axial direction is initiated by the liquid–gas velocity difference, and the following Rayleigh–Taylor instability in the transverse direction is stimulated by the acceleration of the wave crest [19]. The three-dimensional wavy film structure is clearly identified under the practical operating condition of bipropellant thrusters.Fig. 4 Transient behavior of film-cooling flow (MR=1.6).Fig. 5 Typical film flow along the chamber wall (t=50  ms, MR=1.6).C. Measurement of Film FrontThe visualization results comparing the three MR conditions at t=50  ms are presented in Fig.6a. The white circles show the film front. As MR increases, the film flow rate decreases, leading to the shorter film length. The wavy film is consistently confirmed. Figure6b quantifies the mean film lengths of L, with a standard deviation in the three pulses. The film extends to L=40  mm at MR=1.0, while it shortens to being L=20  mm at MR=2.1, evidencing the strong effect of the film flow rate on the film length. We quantitatively discuss the transient behavior of the film extension. The yellow line in Fig.7a corresponds to the measurement location on θ=−π/2, where the film front is clearly identified, and the axial direction is defined as x. Here, the film front on θ=−π/2 can be shorter than the most extended length in Fig.6. The x−t diagram of brightness on θ=−π/2 at every 2ms is presented in Fig.7b. The extension of the film front downstream is clearly visible for all the MR conditions. The film extends fast after ignition, gradually reaching the constant length at t=50  ms. Figure7c shows the time series of film length and the film front velocity Vfront by measuring the position of yellow cross symbols in Fig.7b. The film length is always longer at the smaller MR condition, and the film front velocity is slower typically at MR=2.1. The film front velocity is Vfront≈1  m/s at t=10  ms, approximately one-tenth of the injection velocity of the film fuel jet of Vinj∼O(101)  m/s. The slowly spreading film front indicates that the initial inertia force of film fuel quickly diminishes by the strong friction force from the chamber wall close to the collision point, and the film front develops driven by shear stress from the fast combustion gas stream of O(102)  m/s. After that, the value of Vfront gradually approaches Vfront=0  m/s at t=50  ms, in which the film front completely evaporates. The monotonical deceleration of Vfront suggests that the film front temperature promptly reaches the saturation temperature and continuously evaporates. The film keeps evaporating from the liquid–gas interface; thus, the film front becomes thinner, heated a longer time after injection on the wall. Then, the viscous force inside the liquid film, inversely proportional to the film thickness assuming the Couette flow [19], becomes large downstream, leading to the deceleration of the film front. The deceleration of Vfront also indicates that the effect of thinning film on Vfront overcomes the acceleration of combustion gas from t=0  ms to 50ms.Fig. 6 The relationship between film length and mixture ratio at t=50  ms (Pc≈1  MPa).Fig. 7 Extension of film front.D. Measurement of Film BodyFigure8 shows the distributions of local film velocities at t=50  ms, by measuring the axial movement in 0.5ms at respective locations. Irrespective of MR, it is obvious that the film velocity rapidly decreases to approximately Vlocal=1.0  m/s at x=5  mm by losing the initial inertia force. Then, Vlocal gradually decelerates to being 0  m/s at the film front. Since the trend of Vlocal is consistent with Vfront, the effect of wettability on the film motion is insignificant, as previously reported by Yarygin etal. [24].Figure9a shows the mean local film velocities V¯local at x>5  mm after the immediate deceleration of Vlocal with error bars suggesting a standard deviation in the three pulses. Here, we obtain V¯local≈1  m/s. The lifetime of the film from injection to completing evaporation is estimated as T∼L/V¯local∼O(10−2)  s, consistent with Fig.7. From the film flow rate Q, V¯local, and D, we deduce the mean film thickness as follows: h=QπD⋅V¯local(2)Fig. 8 Local film velocity distribution.Figure9b presents that the film thickness is h∼10  μm. The cross section of the film is covered by the velocity boundary layer in a timescale of τν after collision of the fuel jet on the wall, τν∼h2ν∼O(10−4)  s(3)which is much shorter than T. The corresponding axial distance is of Vinjτν∼O(10−3)  m, equivalent with the smooth film region in Fig.5b. Analogically, the film temperature becomes saturation temperature heated by the combustion gas in a timescale of τα: τα∼h2α∼O(10−3)  s(4)Both τν and τα are enough shorter than T, demonstrating that the film is a thin film, fully covered by the boundary layer of velocity and temperature. The film continuously evaporates, leading to thinning and deceleration, consistent with the previous discussion, demonstrated in Figs.7 and 8. The axial distance reaching the saturation temperature is estimated as Vinjτν+V¯local(τα−τν)∼O(10−3)  m, coinciding with less than 10% of L; thus, the film starts to evaporate soon after the collision from the liquid–gas interface.Fig. 9 Film flow characteristics at x>5  mm.E. WavelengthThe film is not smooth but forms a wavy structure, as demonstrated in Fig.10a. In this figure, there are five wave crests visible along the axial directions as depicted by the lines, induced by the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. Figure10b shows the mean values of axial wavelength λ with a standard deviation. The film has instability waves of λ≈1  mm, much longer than the film thickness. The film Reynolds number is Ref=Vlocalh/v∼10, in which the effect of viscosity on the instability is insignificant, and λ is determined by boundary-layer thickness of the gas stream and density ratio of liquid to gas [19,33], whose values are consistent under the same chamber pressure. As the result, λ is independent of MR.F. Transient Behavior of Film FlowFrom the preceding discussion, we summarize the sequential scenario for the transient behavior of film flow, as schematically shown in Fig.11. The coolant jet collides with the chamber wall.The injected liquid jet with Vinj∼O(101)  m/s impinges on the chamber wall.The coolant film decelerates rapidly.After the impingement, the liquid film is produced. The film decelerates by the wall friction force being Vlocal∼1  m/s by immediately diminishing the initial inertial force, simultaneously heated by the combustion gas reaching the saturation temperature in several millimeters from the collision point.The combustion gas drives the film flow.In this region, the film flow extends sheared by the fast combustion gas. The large velocity difference between the liquid and the gas leads to instabilities, producing ripple waves on the film as illustrated in Fig.11b. The film continuously evaporates and becomes thin. As a result, the local film velocity gradually decays toward the film front.Evaporation completes.The film completes evaporation at the axial length balancing the heat input from the combustion gas being equivalent with the latent heat. At the MR condition, the film flow rate is larger, and the film length becomes longer.Fig. 10 Axial wavelength at t=50  ms.Fig. 11 Transient behavior of film flow.IV. ConclusionsFor enriching the essential understanding of film-cooling technique, we succeeded in the direct high-speed optical measurements of coolant liquid film dynamics inside a bipropellant thruster chamber made of quartz glass, using MMH and MON3 as propellants, from the ignition to the steady state in the 50ms firing duration. We were the first to quantify the coolant liquid film dynamics and the film length exposed to the hypergolic combustion gas stream, revealing the unsteady film dynamics under the same operating conditions as 10N-class practical bipropellant thrusters. The experimental results sequentially revealed the transient behavior of the film flow as follows: the coolant fuel jet impinged on the chamber wall being the liquid film; the friction force between the chamber wall and the film rapidly decelerated the film velocity as one-tenth of the injection velocity; then the film moved downstream, sheared by the fast combustion gas downstream, in which the film continuously evaporated and thinned; and eventually the film front completely evaporated by the heat input from the hot combustion gas. The liquid film formed the typical ripple wave structure, covered by the velocity and thermal boundary layers. The effect of the mixture ratio was significant as the film flow rate increased at the small mixture ratio, leading to the longer film length.L. MauriceAssociate EditorAppendix: Dominant Parameter to Determine the Film LengthAs explained in Sec.III, the film length is determined by the balance of supplied film flow rate and the evaporation rate from the film surface. Here, we discuss the effect of difference of adiabatic flame temperature of the core flame produced by the impinging propellants on the film length at each test case. The mixture ratio of MRcore for the core combustion gas, except for the film-cooling fuel, is larger than the total mixture ratio of MR: MRcore=m˙Om˙F=MR1−FC(A1)In the present test, we obtain MRcore=1.4∼3.0 corresponding to MR=1.0∼2.1 at FC=0.3.Figure A1 shows the relationship between the adiabatic flame temperature of Tflame and MRcore, calculated by NASA chemical equilibrium analysis code [32]. Corresponding to MR=1.0, 1.6, and 2.1, we obtain Tflame=2830  K, 3160K, and 3110K respectively. As shown in Table2, the chamber pressure of each test is fixed, and the total flow rate of propellants (m˙O+m˙F+m˙FC) is the same. Hence, m˙FC is inversely proportional to 1+MR. At MR=1.0 and 2.1, m˙FC decreases 60%. Since we confirm Tflame changes approximately 10% against MRcore, the temperature difference between the core gas and coolant film is almost constant. Thus, we conclude that the film flow rate is the dominant parameter to determine the film length, in which the film length shortens at a larger MR condition, consistent with Fig.6b. Assuming a case that the coolant film is mainly heated by the covering self-decomposing gas, not by the core combustion gas, the film length is reasonably affected by the film flow rate.Fig. A1 The relationship between MRcore and Tflame of core combustion gas.AcknowledgmentWe wish to express our sincere gratitude to all people involved in this research, especially the members of the thruster test team at the Isahaya site of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.\r            References\r        [1] Sutton G.

        "content": "AbstractA hybrid rockoon, which is a hybrid rocket launched from a high-altitude balloon, is proposed. The rocket system configuration was studied for single-stage or multiple-stage rockets, and the performance and range safety requirements were considered. The propellants of the hybrid-rocket motor are a low-melting-point thermoplastic fuel and nitrous oxide, which are beneficial, owing to their mechanical properties at cold temperatures experienced in high-altitude environments. Three-dimensional launch trajectory analyses were performed for science missions aimed at sampling cosmic dust levitating in the upper stratosphere. The apogee altitude can be significantly increased by elevating the altitude of the launch point because the problem of low thrust level of the hybrid rocket is solved by increasing the nozzle expansion ratio. Suborbital trajectories with multiple apogee points and orbital missions to extremely low Earth orbits are presented, which provide a long flight path in the upper atmosphere. The sequence of events and flight characteristics of the proposed hybrid rockoon system are discussed, and necessary technological improvements in the structure and propulsion systems are presented.\r            References\r        [1] Karabeyoglu A., Stevens J., Geyzel D., Cantwell B. and Micheletti D., “High Performance Hybrid Upper Stage Motor,” 47th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, AIAA Paper  2011-6025, July 2011, pp.1–25. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2011-6025 LinkGoogle Scholar[2] Kobald M., Fischer U., Tomilin K., Petrarolo A. and Schmierer C., “Hybrid Experimental Rocket Stuttgart: A Low-Cost Technology Demonstrator,” Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, Vol.55, No.2, 2018, pp.484–500. https://doi.org/10.2514/1.A34035 LinkGoogle Scholar[3] Casalino L., Letizia F. and Pastrone D., “Optimization of Hybrid Upper-Stage Motor with Coupled Evolutionary/Indirect Procedure,” Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol.30, No.5, 2014, pp.1390–1398. https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35111 LinkGoogle Scholar[4] Wada Y., Kato R., Kato N. and Hori K., “Small Rocket Launch Experiment Using Low Melting Point Thermoplastic Fuel/N2O Hybrid Rocket,” 49th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference, AIAA Paper  2013-4050, July 2013.

        "content": "AbstractThe complex wing motion of insects and small birds leads to high lift production in nature. Specific lift-enhancing mechanisms arise from the combination of a horizontal stroke motion and a secondary wing pitching motion. Research around flapping wing nano air vehicles (FWNAVs) copies this wing motion to fly small drones, in an effort to benefit from the same mechanisms. A flapping wing aerodynamic model can predict the force production of the FWNAV and helps to understand the influence of the wing kinematics thereon. This work starts from a quasi-steady model expression for the aerodynamics and proposes a wind-tunnel procedure to identify the force coefficients in the model empirically. The procedure is based on a test case performed by the AVT-202 research team that combines wing translation and wing rotation, imitating the aerodynamic condition of the flapping wing in a simplified setup. Comparison of measurements and model simulations demonstrates that the procedure can be used to update the model parameters for our specific FWNAV configuration, leading to an empirical relation for the force coefficients. Simulations with the updated model using the empirical relations show good agreement with measured force production for a wide range of input variables.\r            References\r        [1] Galinski C., “Influence of MAV Characteristics on their Applications,” Aviation, Vol.9, No.4, 2005, pp.16–23. https://doi.org/10.1080/16487788.2005.9635913 Google Scholar[2] Petricca L., Ohlckers P. and Grinde C., “Micro- and Nano-Air Vehicles: State of the Art,” International Journal of Aerospace Engineering, Vol.2011, April2011, pp.1–17. https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/214549 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[3] Wilkins P., “Insect-Like Flapping, the Propulsion of Micro Air Vehicles,” Annex of Ph.D. Dissertation: Some Unsteady Aerodynamics Relevant to Insect-Inspired Flapping-Wing Micro Air Vehicles, Cranfield Univ., Cranfield, England, U.K., 2008, pp.391–403.

The most advanced space systems will possess the ability to adapt and improve performance over time, or online learning. This work presents a novel framework that uses the highly researched artificial intelligence paradigm, reinforcement learning, to perform online learning. The spacecraft attitude control problem is used as a benchmark, with experimental results for using reinforcement learning to train neural spacecraft attitude controllers. Additionally, experimental results in a simulation environment are also shown to compare and contrast two state-of-the-art single-agent continuous control reinforcement learning algorithms to motivate their use in the online learning scenario.\r            References\r        [1] Gaudet B., Linares R. and Furfaro R., “Six Degree-of-Freedom Hovering over an Asteroid with Unknown Environmental Dynamics via Reinforcement Learning,” AIAA Scitech 2020 Forum, AIAA Paper  2020-0953, 2020. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2020-0953 LinkGoogle Scholar[2] Frank J.

        "content": "AbstractUncertainty in the microstructures has a significant influence on the material properties. The microstructural uncertainty arises from the fluctuations that occur during thermomechanical processing and can alter the expected material properties and performance by propagating over multiple length scales. It can even lead to the material failure if the deviations in the critical properties exceed a certain limit. We introduce a linear programming (LP) based method to quantify the effects of the microstructure uncertainty on the desired material properties of the titanium–7wt % aluminum alloy, which is a candidate material for aerospace applications. The microstructure is represented using the orientation distribution function (ODF) approach. The LP problem solves for the mean values and covariance of the ODFs that maximize a volume-averaged linear material property. However, the analytical procedure is not applicable for maximizing nonlinear material properties where microstructural uncertainties are present. Therefore, an artificial neural network based sampling method is developed to estimate the mean values and covariance of the ODFs that satisfy design constraints and maximize the volume-averaged nonlinear material properties. A couple of other design problems are also illustrated to clarify the applications of the proposed models for both linear and nonlinear properties.\r            References\r        [1] Cai G. and Mahadevan S., “Uncertainty Quantification of Manufacturing Process Effects on Macroscale Material Properties,” International Journal for Multiscale Computational Engineering, Vol.14, No.3, 2016, pp.191–213. https://doi.org/10.1615/IntJMultCompEng.2016015552 Google Scholar[2] Hu Z. and Mahadevan S., “Uncertainty Quantification in Prediction of Material Properties During Additive Manufacturing,” Scripta Materialia, Vol.135, July 2017, pp.135–140. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scriptamat.2016.10.014 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[3] Nath P., Hu Z. and Mahadevan S., “Multi-Level Uncertainty Quantification in additive Manufacturing,” Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium—An Additive Manufacturing Conference, 2017, pp.922–937.

        "content": "AbstractMultidimensional numerical simulations are performed to investigate the evolution and formation of unburned fuels for a shock–fuel jet interaction scenario. A full set of Navier–Stokes equations with detailed chemical mechanisms are solved, and the results are analyzed through the Lagrangian method with the goal of improving combustion efficiency in supersonic flows. The flame morphology of a two-dimensional (2-D) non-premixed reactive shock–bubble interaction is first simulated and studied, in which unburned hydrogen is found to prevent efficient combustion. By applying the Lagrangian particle tracking method, most of the unburned hydrogen wrapped into the primary vortex turns out to be initially located upon the symmetry line of the bubble. Motivated by the idea of breaking the primary vortex, this study designs a novel geometry of a concentric bubble, which improves combustion efficiency to 94.4% in contrast to a solid fuel bubble (74%) due to multivortex interaction and a thick bridge structure. With the consistency between qualitative and quantitative 2-D and three-dimensional (3-D) flow dynamics, the idea of a 2-D concentric-bubble configuration is effectively extended to a 3-D coaxial jet interacting with oblique shock despite the existence of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability.\r            References\r        [1] Curran E., Heiser W. and Pratt D., “Fluid Phenomena in Scramjet Combustion Systems,” Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, Vol.28, No.1, 1996, pp.323–360. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.fl.28.010196.001543 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[2] Rudinger G. and Somers L., “Behaviour of Small Regions of Different Gases Carried in Accelerated Gas Flows,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol.7, No.2, 1960, pp.161–176. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112060001419 Google Scholar[3] Picone J. and Boris J., “Vorticity Generation by Shock Propagation Through Bubbles in a Gas,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol.189, April1988, pp.23–51. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112088000904 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[4] Marble F., Hendricks G. and Zukoski E., “Progress Toward Shock Enhancement of Supersonic Combustion Processes,” 23rd Joint Propulsion Conference, AIAA Paper  1987-1880, 1987. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.1987-1880 LinkGoogle Scholar[5] Marble F.

        "content": "AbstractThis paper presents two-dimensional heat transfer results for the first time in an expansion tube, using infrared thermography at a Mars entry condition. Experiments were performed in the X2 expansion tube at The University of Queensland in a Martian (CO2/N2) test gas on a wedge model. Infrared filtering from 3.5 to 4  μm was performed in data acquisition to remove significant radiation from the shock layer. Thermal images of a preheated surface from the infrared camera were used together with measurements from a fast response infrared sensor to obtain heat flux maps at a hypervelocity condition with flight duplicated enthalpy. Experimental heat flux results have an uncertainty of less than 10% and agreed with laminar convective theoretical correlations to within 16%, making thermography suitable for heat transfer measurements in expansion tubes. This technique has potential for future applications in studying wall/near-wall viscous phenomena dependent on surface temperatures in expansion tubes.\r            References\r        [1] Flaherty W. and Austin J., “Comparative Surface Heat Transfer Measurements in Hypervelocity Flow,” Journal of Thermophysics and Heat Transfer, Vol.25, No.1, 2011, pp.180–183. https://doi.org/10.2514/1.50450 LinkGoogle Scholar[2] Hollis B.
