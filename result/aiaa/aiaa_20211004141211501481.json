        "content": "AbstractThis paper investigates a novel method to increase the accuracy of ballistic deployment by controlling the spin rate of the lander, assuming that the lander is spherical. The concept of the bouncing return trajectory is proposed, which takes off and lands at the same point on the asteroid surface. The spin rate of a spherical lander is controlled before each impact to change its postimpact velocity so that it can be driven into the bouncing return trajectory and remains in the vicinity of its original landing site until it finally rests on the surface. First, the properties of bouncing return trajectories are investigated based on a spherical model. Based on the contact dynamics, the analytical solution of the required spin rate to change velocity is derived. Next, candidate deployment trajectories of the proposed method are studied under different asteroid parameters. Finally, the feasibility and robustness of the method are verified using a model of the asteroid Bennu. It is found that the proposed deployment method can achieve a precise landing if the surface environment is ascertained and largely reduce the landing dispersion under an uncertain environment. This paper provides a novel idea for future asteroid lander deployment and surface exploration missions.\r            References\r        [1] Yoshimitsu T., Kubota T. and Nakatani I., “MINERVARover Became a Small Artificial Solar Satellite,” 20th Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellite, AIAA/USU, 2006, Paper SSC06-IV-4.

        "content": "AbstractThe channel wing is a lift-enhancement concept pioneered by Willard Ray Custer in the late 1940s in an effort to provide a fixed-wing aircraft with short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities. This paper experimentally investigates the possibility of using Custer channel wings for slow flight and STOL of small (under 35kg) fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The Custer unmanned aircraft developed at the University of Southampton is introduced in this paper, including details of the installed channel wings and other systems necessary for slow-flight operation. Results from wind-tunnel tests are presented, showing a significant lift increase due to the channel wings in the range of airspeeds of interest. Flight tests are carried out to demonstrate the slow flight and STOL capabilities of the aircraft, showing superior stall characteristics and a two-thirds reduction of the runway length required when using the channel wings. Flight-test comparisons to a conventional wing–propeller configuration show superior slow-flight performance and 7–9% lower cruise speed of the channel-wing aircraft.\r            References\r        [1] Young D.

        "content": "AbstractThis paper describes the results of a system study for the in-space assembly of large optical telescopes using a building block approach involving multiple mirror segments. Such an approach is enabled by CubeSat rendezvous and docking and mirror steering technologies for compensating misalignment of the assembly. This concept thus removes the constraints imposed by the limited volume of launchers’ fairing, and hence larger telescope dimensions can be envisaged, leading to new observation capabilities. Each mirror segment is mounted on top of a small satellite, containing the miniaturized subsystems to achieve autonomous docking to either the service module containing the science instruments or other segments to build up the primary mirror. A systems’ design of all the elements constituting the assembly is provided, including tradeoffs, optimization, as well as mass and power budgets. The proposed solution scales with the size of the telescope and can be used to build primary mirrors as large as 20m in diameter. The critical guidance, navigation, and control function is introduced, and related docking performances are presented. The results indicate that the in-space assembly of such large telescopes is feasible once these two key technologies are demonstrated in flight in the coming years.\r            References\r        [1] “James Webb Space Telescope (WEBB/JWST) NASA,” NASA, March 2021, https://jwst.nasa.gov.

        "content": "AbstractSelf-actuated deployable space structures present a novel challenge for deployment dynamics modeling efforts, where the system-level influence of strain energy components must be captured. Here, the free deployment of an origami-folded structure through actuation of strain energy hinges is studied. Studies include experimental testing, multibody dynamics modeling, and finite element modeling. An approach for modeling high strain tape spring hinges for use in a multibody simulation of free-deployment dynamics analysis is presented and demonstrated. This approach considers hinges with multiple degrees of freedom beyond the primary fold axis angle. A novel folded deployable structure is designed and prototyped with a segmented fold pattern and strain energy hinges integrated in the design. A suite of deployment tests is conducted on the prototype using videogrammetry. A full simulation of the prototype is constructed from a multibody dynamics model and the hinge model, and the predicted deployment behavior for relative hinge states is evaluated against the experimental testing. Additionally, the prototype deployment is replicated using an explicit dynamic finite element analysis for a performance comparison. The models demonstrate strong correlation for deployment time predictions across the relative hinge states, and the finite element analysis correlates all deployment behaviors.\r            References\r        [1] Zirbel S.

        "content": "AbstractThe Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) spacecraft landed successfully on 26 November 2018 to conduct an exploration of the interior of Mars. To meet NASA’s requirement for communications during critical events, the InSight lander transmitted telemetry continuously throughout entry, descent, and landing. This allowed the public to witness the landing in real time. The transmissions were received by five assets: three at Mars and two on Earth. These included real-time relay of telemetry by the first deep-space CubeSats. This paper describes the constraints on the design of an entry, design, and landing communication link; the uncertainties in the trajectory; and the modeling that was used to meet these constraints. It then reports on the actual performance of each link, including an unexpected degradation of signal to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The lessons learned from this process contributed to the successful relay of data from the Perseverance lander, as well as to the design of future landing communications systems.\r            References\r        [1] Maddock R.

        "content": "AbstractSmall, low-thrust, long-burn-time solid propellant rocket motors could provide propulsion for a new class of kilogram-scale, transonic, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper investigates technological challenges of small, low-thrust solid rocket motors: slow-burn solid propellants, motors that have low thrust relative to their size (and thus have low chamber pressure), thermal protection for the motor case, and small nozzles that can withstand long burn times. Slow-burn propellants were developed using ammonium perchlorate and 0–20% oxamide (burn-rate suppressant), with burn rates of 1–4  mm⋅s−1 at 1MPa. Using these propellants, a low-thrust motor successfully operated at a thrust/burn area ratio 10 times less than that of typical solid rocket motors. This kilogram-scale motor can provide 5–10N of thrust for 1–3min. An ablative thermal protection liner was tested in these firings, and a new ceramic-insulated nozzle was demonstrated. This paper shows that small, low-thrust solid motors are feasible and presents a baseline design for the integration of such a motor into a small UAV.\r            References\r        [1] Jane’s All the World’s Aircraft: Unmanned, IHS Markit, London, 2016.

        "content": "AbstractWe conduct a high-speed visualization of coolant liquid film dynamics inside a 10N-class bipropellant thruster using monomethylhydrazine and a mixture of nitrogen tetroxide with approximately 3% nitric oxide as propellants at equivalent conditions with the flight model. The direct visualization of the liquid film inside a quartz glass chamber demonstrates the transient dynamics of film flow from ignition to cutoff for the first time. The scenario for the life of the film flow is found as follows: the coolant fuel jet impinges on the chamber wall being the liquid film; the friction force from the chamber wall rapidly decelerates the film as one-tenth of the injection velocity; next, the film moves sheared by the fast combustion gas downstream; and eventually the film completely evaporates by heat transfer from the hot combustion gas. The liquid film presents the typical ripple wave structure, covered by the velocity and thermal boundary layers. The effect of the mixture ratio is significant as the film flow rate increases at a small mixture ratio, leading to the longer film length.NomenclatureDinner diameter of the chamber, mFCfilm-cooling ratehfilm thickness, mLfilm length, mm˙Ffuel mass flow rate, g/sm˙FCfilm mass flow rate, g/sm˙Ooxidizer mass flow rate, g/sMRoverall mixture ratioMRcoremixture ratio of core flowPcchamber pressure, MPaQvolumetric flow rate, m3/sReffilm Reynolds numberTfilm lifetime, sttime, sTflameadiabatic flame temperature, Kνkinematic viscosity, m2/sVfrontfilm front velocity, m/sVinjfilm injection velocity, m/sVlocallocal film velocity, m/sαthermal diffusivity of film, m2/sεexpansion ratio of the nozzleθcircumferential phase of chamber, radλwavelength of film flow, mρfilm density, kg/m3ταtimescale for temperature boundary layer, sτνtimescale for velocity boundary layer, sI. IntroductionBipropellant thrusters are widely used to control orbit and attitude for geostationary satellite buses that require higher specific impulse and larger thrust unachievable by monopropellant thrusters [1,2]. Combinations of hypergolic fuel and oxidizer, such as hydrazine or monomethylhydrazine (MMH) for fuel and a mixture of nitrogen tetroxide with approximately 3% nitric oxide (MON3) for oxidizer, eliminate complex ignition systems. In the recent and future cargo spacecraft for the International Space Station [3–6] and in planetary exploration missions for descent and ascent modules [7–9], the bipropellant thrusters keep playing an essential role. The bipropellant thrusters use a combustion chamber generally made of ceramic [10] or high-temperature heat-resistant metal, such as niobium alloy [11,12] or one of the precious metals [13,14]. Inside the combustion chamber, the fuel and oxidizer jets ejected from an injector impinge to form a liquid sheet, followed by sheet atomization, mixing, ignition, and combustion, in a sequential fashion. As schematically depicted in Fig.1, the chamber wall must tolerate heat transfer from the hot combustion gas, exceeding 3000K; thus, a film-cooling technique is widely employed by extending a thin liquid film on the chamber inner surface by directly impinging fuel jets and spreading along as a liquid film [15]. The liquid film produced on the chamber wall elongates downstream with evaporation, developing to a certain length at the balancing point between the heat input and the latent heat, reaching a steady state at last. The chamber wall temperature in the area covered by the coolant film can remain at the saturation temperature of liquid film, avoiding direct heat input from the combustion gas. It is important for designing thrusters to retain a sufficient flow rate for the film-cooling fuel and simultaneously to minimize the film flow rate for improving specific impulse. By predicting the film extension length based on a physical understanding of the film flow dynamics, the compatible management of thermal tolerance and performance is strongly demanded.Several past studies have been devoted to liquid film dynamics. Kinney etal. [16] initiatively took snapshots of a liquid film flow in a transparent tube with a cocurrent fast hot gas, presenting the wavy film formation due to strong shear stress by the gas stream. Cherdantsev etal. [17] and Shinan etal. [18] also observed the liquid film flow sheared by a high-velocity gas stream. Inoue and Maeda [19] succeeded in the comprehensive formulation describing the unstable liquid film dynamics. Stechman etal. [20] tried to predict the film length based on heat transfer between the combustion gas and chamber wall. Shine etal. [21] proposed a one-dimensional control volume approach for a fundamental energy-balance concept. There are some semi-empirical correlations for various combinations of propellants such as hydrogen peroxide/kerosene [22] and liquid oxygen (LOX)/liquid hydrogen [23].Fig. 1 Schematics of temperature and coolant liquid film distributions inside a bipropellant thruster.One of the issues that arises is a lack of experimental data for coolant liquid film dynamics under an operating combustion condition inside a practical thruster. Yarygin etal. [24] experimentally measured the film thickness and velocity subjected to a sonic air flow by using capacitance sensors and quantified the amount of droplet entrainment. Knuth [25] conducted experiments using the hot air flow with water as the liquid coolant in a tube. Morrell [26] employed small rocket engines operating with three different coolant films: water, ethyl alcohol, and liquid ammonia. Arnold etal. [27] experimentally measured temperature distribution of a LOX/liquid methane combustor and studied the film-cooling efficiency. These studies, however, focused on the film-cooling flow at the steady states, and there have been limited experimental data available reporting the developing film dynamics before reaching the steady film length. Consequently, as recently emphasized by Shine and Nidhi [28], it is still difficult to accurately predict the film length, attributed to the limited quantitative experimental data especially for the unsteady film dynamics inside a practically operating bipropellant thruster.Therefore, in the present paper, we conduct a high-speed optical measurement inside a quartz glass chamber, quantifying the coolant liquid film dynamics and the film length exposed to the hypergolic combustion gas stream. Based on the experimental results, we investigate the effect of chamber wall, combustion gas, and evaporation on the film flow. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to report the unsteady film dynamics under the same operating conditions as 10N-class practical bipropellant thrusters.II. Experimental MethodFigure2 shows a schematic of the experimental setup. From upstream, there are two tanks for fuel and oxidizer pressurized by helium gas, solenoid valves for the respective paths, and the bipropellant thruster including the propellant valves. Detailed explanations can be found in our previous paper [29].We used the combination of MMH and MON3 for fuel and oxidizer, respectively. Table1 shows their major properties [30,31]. For the coolant film, a higher boiling point and lower vapor pressure are preferable characteristics to be less evaporative and cover the inner wall of the combustion chamber for a longer time. This test campaign uses MMH for the coolant film as usually employed in practical thrusters.Fig. 2 Schematic of the experimental setup [29]. (Reprinted with permission from Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol.36, No.5, 2020, pp.677–684 Copyright©2020 by AIAA, Inc.)Allowing for the direct observation of the film-cooling flow dynamics, the combustion chamber is made from quartz glass, shown in Fig.3a. The chamber is integrally manufactured with the throat and the nozzle. The inner diameter of the chamber is D=10  mm, and the expansion ratio of the nozzle is ε=8. The combustion chamber is mounted horizontally to the injector face plate by the metal holder. The film-cooling flow is visualized using a high-speed camera (Vision Research, Phantom Miro M310) through the open window of the holder from the horizontal direction of θ=0, depicted in Fig.3b. The recording rate is 24,000fps for self-luminous images, and 51,000fps for backlight images. The chamber pressure is measured by a pressure transducer, KYOWA PHL-A-5MP-B, with a sampling rate of 1kHz. The high-speed camera and the pressure transducer are synchronized with the input signal to the propellant valve.The thruster has a single unlike-impinging type injector [29] for the core spray on the central axis of the combustion chamber, and two fuel jets for the film flow on the inner chamber wall. The core fuel and the film-cooling fuel are introduced to the individual injector hole through the same valve and manifold. The timing of coolant film flow and core flow are almost the same due to the same flow velocity calculated by the mass flow rate and the area of each injector hole. The sheet of the core fan is produced on the plane of θ=0. The two injector holes for the coolant film are allocated on the opposite sides at θ=0 and π, respectively. The coolant jet collides with the chamber wall 2mm downstream from the injector plate, spreading along the chamber wall as a liquid film. The opening response time is 2 to 3ms [29], indicating that the film flow is in the stable condition at the last moment of 50ms opening time. We visualize the back side of liquid film spreading in the area of −π/2<θ<π/2 from the injector face plate to the throat.Fig. 3 The quartz glass chamber.Table2 shows the experimental conditions. All the experiments were conducted at sea level with mixture ratios of MR=1.0,1.6, and 2.1 calculated as MR=m˙Om˙F+m˙FC(1)The target chamber pressure was set to approximately 1MPa equivalent with the flight model with the same total flow rate of (m˙O+m˙F+m˙F). The Reynolds number of the combustion gas is 3×105  in turbulent condition, based on the length scale of D and gas properties obtained by the chemical equilibrium analysis [32]. The propellant valve motion controlling the firing mode is set to 50ms for opening time and 950ms for closing time, with a cycle of 1000ms. Three pulses are sequentially repeated for each MR condition. It is shown in [29] that the time history of chamber pressure is almost the same just before cutting off, therefore three pulses provide sufficient samples. In the following, the mean experimental results indicate the averaged values in the three pulses.III. Results and DiscussionTo reveal the coolant liquid film dynamics, we present visualization results of the developing coolant film dynamics and then show quantitative measurement results of the film length, velocity, thickness, and wavelength with changing MR.A. Repeatability EvaluationThe relative difference of averaged chamber pressure during stable combustion among the three pulses is 2.5%; thus, the film flow rate is being reasonably constant in the three pulses at each MR condition. Detailed repeatability of the combustion test is evaluated in [29]. We confirmed that the produced liquid film length in the present experiment was longer than the flight model of the ceramic chamber, because the large heat capacity of the thick quartz glass wall cooled the film. The trend of the film length against MR was consistent between the present glass chamber and the flight model.B. Chamber Pressure and Film ExtensionFigure4 shows time history of the chamber pressure from ignition to cutoff at MR=1.6 and visualization results of the film-cooling flow. In Fig.4a, the valve-opening signal to the propellant valve indicated by the dotted line is applied at t=0  ms, and ignition is detected by the pressure transducer at t=9  ms. The time lag is attributed to the dribble volume upstream of the chamber and to the pressure-sensing delay [29]. The closed circles in Fig.4a indicate the chamber pressure corresponding to the visualization results in Fig.4b. In Fig.4b, the film is visible on the chamber wall in front of the combustion flame. The white circles represent the most extended film front. At t=6.7–8.7  ms, the film rapidly propagates. After that, the film gradually extends to the maximum length at t=42.1  ms, in which the film front completely evaporates by the heat transfer from the combustion gas. At t=42.1  ms, the chamber pressure becomes a steady state. The film front keeps the same position until t=50  ms at valve close. Thus, the film length can reach the steady state in the 50ms firing duration as the chamber pressure and the combustion gas velocity reach constant. Another notable phenomenon is that the film flow extends downward as shown in Fig.4b. The reason is that the chamber is set horizontally, resulting in the film flow being affected by gravity to extend downward.Figure5 shows the detailed film flow being the maximum film length at t=50  ms and MR=1.6. Figure5a shows the self-luminous image. A wavy pattern on the film is clearly confirmed up to the film front. The coolant film fully covers the combustion chamber wall at a circumferential direction of −π<θ<π. Figure5b shows the enlarged impinging region by backlight visualization. A part of the film flows upstream of the collision point, contributing to cooling the area close to the injector face plate. We find the smooth film without the waves near the collision point until 3mm downstream. The following wavy pattern shows the typical ripple wave, also reported by Kinney etal. [16] and Cherdantsev etal. [17] in the past, formed by superposing two types of instabilities; the Kelvin–Hermholtz instability along the axial direction is initiated by the liquid–gas velocity difference, and the following Rayleigh–Taylor instability in the transverse direction is stimulated by the acceleration of the wave crest [19]. The three-dimensional wavy film structure is clearly identified under the practical operating condition of bipropellant thrusters.Fig. 4 Transient behavior of film-cooling flow (MR=1.6).Fig. 5 Typical film flow along the chamber wall (t=50  ms, MR=1.6).C. Measurement of Film FrontThe visualization results comparing the three MR conditions at t=50  ms are presented in Fig.6a. The white circles show the film front. As MR increases, the film flow rate decreases, leading to the shorter film length. The wavy film is consistently confirmed. Figure6b quantifies the mean film lengths of L, with a standard deviation in the three pulses. The film extends to L=40  mm at MR=1.0, while it shortens to being L=20  mm at MR=2.1, evidencing the strong effect of the film flow rate on the film length. We quantitatively discuss the transient behavior of the film extension. The yellow line in Fig.7a corresponds to the measurement location on θ=−π/2, where the film front is clearly identified, and the axial direction is defined as x. Here, the film front on θ=−π/2 can be shorter than the most extended length in Fig.6. The x−t diagram of brightness on θ=−π/2 at every 2ms is presented in Fig.7b. The extension of the film front downstream is clearly visible for all the MR conditions. The film extends fast after ignition, gradually reaching the constant length at t=50  ms. Figure7c shows the time series of film length and the film front velocity Vfront by measuring the position of yellow cross symbols in Fig.7b. The film length is always longer at the smaller MR condition, and the film front velocity is slower typically at MR=2.1. The film front velocity is Vfront≈1  m/s at t=10  ms, approximately one-tenth of the injection velocity of the film fuel jet of Vinj∼O(101)  m/s. The slowly spreading film front indicates that the initial inertia force of film fuel quickly diminishes by the strong friction force from the chamber wall close to the collision point, and the film front develops driven by shear stress from the fast combustion gas stream of O(102)  m/s. After that, the value of Vfront gradually approaches Vfront=0  m/s at t=50  ms, in which the film front completely evaporates. The monotonical deceleration of Vfront suggests that the film front temperature promptly reaches the saturation temperature and continuously evaporates. The film keeps evaporating from the liquid–gas interface; thus, the film front becomes thinner, heated a longer time after injection on the wall. Then, the viscous force inside the liquid film, inversely proportional to the film thickness assuming the Couette flow [19], becomes large downstream, leading to the deceleration of the film front. The deceleration of Vfront also indicates that the effect of thinning film on Vfront overcomes the acceleration of combustion gas from t=0  ms to 50ms.Fig. 6 The relationship between film length and mixture ratio at t=50  ms (Pc≈1  MPa).Fig. 7 Extension of film front.D. Measurement of Film BodyFigure8 shows the distributions of local film velocities at t=50  ms, by measuring the axial movement in 0.5ms at respective locations. Irrespective of MR, it is obvious that the film velocity rapidly decreases to approximately Vlocal=1.0  m/s at x=5  mm by losing the initial inertia force. Then, Vlocal gradually decelerates to being 0  m/s at the film front. Since the trend of Vlocal is consistent with Vfront, the effect of wettability on the film motion is insignificant, as previously reported by Yarygin etal. [24].Figure9a shows the mean local film velocities V¯local at x>5  mm after the immediate deceleration of Vlocal with error bars suggesting a standard deviation in the three pulses. Here, we obtain V¯local≈1  m/s. The lifetime of the film from injection to completing evaporation is estimated as T∼L/V¯local∼O(10−2)  s, consistent with Fig.7. From the film flow rate Q, V¯local, and D, we deduce the mean film thickness as follows: h=QπD⋅V¯local(2)Fig. 8 Local film velocity distribution.Figure9b presents that the film thickness is h∼10  μm. The cross section of the film is covered by the velocity boundary layer in a timescale of τν after collision of the fuel jet on the wall, τν∼h2ν∼O(10−4)  s(3)which is much shorter than T. The corresponding axial distance is of Vinjτν∼O(10−3)  m, equivalent with the smooth film region in Fig.5b. Analogically, the film temperature becomes saturation temperature heated by the combustion gas in a timescale of τα: τα∼h2α∼O(10−3)  s(4)Both τν and τα are enough shorter than T, demonstrating that the film is a thin film, fully covered by the boundary layer of velocity and temperature. The film continuously evaporates, leading to thinning and deceleration, consistent with the previous discussion, demonstrated in Figs.7 and 8. The axial distance reaching the saturation temperature is estimated as Vinjτν+V¯local(τα−τν)∼O(10−3)  m, coinciding with less than 10% of L; thus, the film starts to evaporate soon after the collision from the liquid–gas interface.Fig. 9 Film flow characteristics at x>5  mm.E. WavelengthThe film is not smooth but forms a wavy structure, as demonstrated in Fig.10a. In this figure, there are five wave crests visible along the axial directions as depicted by the lines, induced by the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. Figure10b shows the mean values of axial wavelength λ with a standard deviation. The film has instability waves of λ≈1  mm, much longer than the film thickness. The film Reynolds number is Ref=Vlocalh/v∼10, in which the effect of viscosity on the instability is insignificant, and λ is determined by boundary-layer thickness of the gas stream and density ratio of liquid to gas [19,33], whose values are consistent under the same chamber pressure. As the result, λ is independent of MR.F. Transient Behavior of Film FlowFrom the preceding discussion, we summarize the sequential scenario for the transient behavior of film flow, as schematically shown in Fig.11. The coolant jet collides with the chamber wall.The injected liquid jet with Vinj∼O(101)  m/s impinges on the chamber wall.The coolant film decelerates rapidly.After the impingement, the liquid film is produced. The film decelerates by the wall friction force being Vlocal∼1  m/s by immediately diminishing the initial inertial force, simultaneously heated by the combustion gas reaching the saturation temperature in several millimeters from the collision point.The combustion gas drives the film flow.In this region, the film flow extends sheared by the fast combustion gas. The large velocity difference between the liquid and the gas leads to instabilities, producing ripple waves on the film as illustrated in Fig.11b. The film continuously evaporates and becomes thin. As a result, the local film velocity gradually decays toward the film front.Evaporation completes.The film completes evaporation at the axial length balancing the heat input from the combustion gas being equivalent with the latent heat. At the MR condition, the film flow rate is larger, and the film length becomes longer.Fig. 10 Axial wavelength at t=50  ms.Fig. 11 Transient behavior of film flow.IV. ConclusionsFor enriching the essential understanding of film-cooling technique, we succeeded in the direct high-speed optical measurements of coolant liquid film dynamics inside a bipropellant thruster chamber made of quartz glass, using MMH and MON3 as propellants, from the ignition to the steady state in the 50ms firing duration. We were the first to quantify the coolant liquid film dynamics and the film length exposed to the hypergolic combustion gas stream, revealing the unsteady film dynamics under the same operating conditions as 10N-class practical bipropellant thrusters. The experimental results sequentially revealed the transient behavior of the film flow as follows: the coolant fuel jet impinged on the chamber wall being the liquid film; the friction force between the chamber wall and the film rapidly decelerated the film velocity as one-tenth of the injection velocity; then the film moved downstream, sheared by the fast combustion gas downstream, in which the film continuously evaporated and thinned; and eventually the film front completely evaporated by the heat input from the hot combustion gas. The liquid film formed the typical ripple wave structure, covered by the velocity and thermal boundary layers. The effect of the mixture ratio was significant as the film flow rate increased at the small mixture ratio, leading to the longer film length.L. MauriceAssociate EditorAppendix: Dominant Parameter to Determine the Film LengthAs explained in Sec.III, the film length is determined by the balance of supplied film flow rate and the evaporation rate from the film surface. Here, we discuss the effect of difference of adiabatic flame temperature of the core flame produced by the impinging propellants on the film length at each test case. The mixture ratio of MRcore for the core combustion gas, except for the film-cooling fuel, is larger than the total mixture ratio of MR: MRcore=m˙Om˙F=MR1−FC(A1)In the present test, we obtain MRcore=1.4∼3.0 corresponding to MR=1.0∼2.1 at FC=0.3.Figure A1 shows the relationship between the adiabatic flame temperature of Tflame and MRcore, calculated by NASA chemical equilibrium analysis code [32]. Corresponding to MR=1.0, 1.6, and 2.1, we obtain Tflame=2830  K, 3160K, and 3110K respectively. As shown in Table2, the chamber pressure of each test is fixed, and the total flow rate of propellants (m˙O+m˙F+m˙FC) is the same. Hence, m˙FC is inversely proportional to 1+MR. At MR=1.0 and 2.1, m˙FC decreases 60%. Since we confirm Tflame changes approximately 10% against MRcore, the temperature difference between the core gas and coolant film is almost constant. Thus, we conclude that the film flow rate is the dominant parameter to determine the film length, in which the film length shortens at a larger MR condition, consistent with Fig.6b. Assuming a case that the coolant film is mainly heated by the covering self-decomposing gas, not by the core combustion gas, the film length is reasonably affected by the film flow rate.Fig. A1 The relationship between MRcore and Tflame of core combustion gas.AcknowledgmentWe wish to express our sincere gratitude to all people involved in this research, especially the members of the thruster test team at the Isahaya site of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.\r            References\r        [1] Sutton G.

        "content": "AbstractA new method for efficient trajectory planning to resolve potential conflicts among multiple aircraft is proposed. A brief review of aircraft trajectory planning and conflict resolution methods is given first. Next, a new method is proposed that is based on a probabilistic conflict risk map using the predicted probability of conflict with the intention information of the intruders. The risk-map-based method allows the path planning algorithm to simultaneously account for many uncertainties affecting safety, such as positioning error, wind variability, and human errors. Following this, A* algorithm is used to find the cost-minimized trajectory for a single aircraft by considering all other aircraft as intruders. Search heuristic method is implemented to iterate the A* algorithm for all aircraft to optimize the trajectory planning. Convergence and computation efficiency of the proposed method are investigated in detail. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under several important scenarios for air traffic control, such as wind effects, non-cooperative aircraft, minimum disturbance of pilots, and deconflict with flight intent information. Several conclusions are drawn based on the proposed method.\r            References\r        [1] “Policy and Plans: FAA Aerospace Forecast Fiscal Years 2016–2036,”  Federal Aviation Administration Rept.

        "content": "AbstractA hybrid rockoon, which is a hybrid rocket launched from a high-altitude balloon, is proposed. The rocket system configuration was studied for single-stage or multiple-stage rockets, and the performance and range safety requirements were considered. The propellants of the hybrid-rocket motor are a low-melting-point thermoplastic fuel and nitrous oxide, which are beneficial, owing to their mechanical properties at cold temperatures experienced in high-altitude environments. Three-dimensional launch trajectory analyses were performed for science missions aimed at sampling cosmic dust levitating in the upper stratosphere. The apogee altitude can be significantly increased by elevating the altitude of the launch point because the problem of low thrust level of the hybrid rocket is solved by increasing the nozzle expansion ratio. Suborbital trajectories with multiple apogee points and orbital missions to extremely low Earth orbits are presented, which provide a long flight path in the upper atmosphere. The sequence of events and flight characteristics of the proposed hybrid rockoon system are discussed, and necessary technological improvements in the structure and propulsion systems are presented.\r            References\r        [1] Karabeyoglu A., Stevens J., Geyzel D., Cantwell B. and Micheletti D., “High Performance Hybrid Upper Stage Motor,” 47th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, AIAA Paper  2011-6025, July 2011, pp.1–25. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2011-6025 LinkGoogle Scholar[2] Kobald M., Fischer U., Tomilin K., Petrarolo A. and Schmierer C., “Hybrid Experimental Rocket Stuttgart: A Low-Cost Technology Demonstrator,” Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, Vol.55, No.2, 2018, pp.484–500. https://doi.org/10.2514/1.A34035 LinkGoogle Scholar[3] Casalino L., Letizia F. and Pastrone D., “Optimization of Hybrid Upper-Stage Motor with Coupled Evolutionary/Indirect Procedure,” Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol.30, No.5, 2014, pp.1390–1398. https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35111 LinkGoogle Scholar[4] Wada Y., Kato R., Kato N. and Hori K., “Small Rocket Launch Experiment Using Low Melting Point Thermoplastic Fuel/N2O Hybrid Rocket,” 49th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference, AIAA Paper  2013-4050, July 2013.

        "content": "AbstractThis paper examines thermal response behind the high-Mach integrated control (HIMICO) experiment’s engine. In this experimental aircraft, instruments must be protected from heat load due to exhaust gas; therefore, a coupling calculation between the fluid and the wall is conducted to confirm the performance of HIMICO’s thermal protection system (TPS). First, the validity of the coupling calculation is confirmed through comparison with aerodynamic heating on a hollow cylinder. The present calculation result can reproduce the surface temperature distribution on the cylinder better than previous work has managed because we consider the turbulence effect. Second, one-dimensional heat-transfer analysis is conducted on the external nozzle, and the appropriateness of the calculation result is confirmed through comparison with the ramjet-engine experiment. Finally, a coupling calculation between the fluid and the wall is conducted to investigate the local temperature distribution. The calculation result indicates that the temperature increase easily meets design requirements and that TPS performance is sufficient.NomenclatureAarea, m2Aipre-exponential coefficient for each reactionBiactivation temperature for each reaction, KCpSpecific heat, J/(kg⋅K)Ddiffusion coefficient, m2/setotal energy, J/m3Finviscid flux vectorFvviscous flux vectorhspecific enthalpy, J/kgh¯specific enthalpy of resin, J/kgkturbulence energy, m2/s2m˙mass flux, kg/(m2⋅s)Nfnumber of surfaces in each cellniorder for each reactionppressure, PaQconserved-quantity vectorqheat flux, W/m2Ttemperature, KTvector about the turbulence effect in the turbulence modelttime, suvelocity, m/sxfcomponent of the unit normal vectorYmass fractionI. IntroductionIn modern times, the aviation industry has become indispensable due to globalization. If higher flight velocities can be achieved, flight times can be shortened, and the amount of transportation can be increased, generating significant economic effects [1]. A previous attempt at a supersonic airplane, the Concorde, which can fly at Mach 2, was developed and operated by France and the United Kingdom. The Concorde was operated as the only supersonic passenger plane, but because of its high cost and environmental load, it concluded operations in 2003. Attempts at supersonic passenger planes presently continue throughout the world. For example, a structural investigation of LAPCATII, which is supposed to fly at Mach 5, has been conducted by the European Union [2].The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) proposes to conduct a demonstration test of a hypersonic passenger plane within the next 20years [3]. JAXA has suggested separating the demonstration test into three steps and investigating them one at a time to validate both the flight technology and the integrated technology of the entire aircraft under actual environmental conditions [4]. The aircraft used in the first stage is called the high-Mach integrated control (HIMICO) experiment. The objective of the first stage is to investigate the interaction between the airframe and the air-breathing engine, which has already been developed independently. In detail, this experiment aims to verify the flight-control logic and instruments mounted on the airframe and to operate the variable-intake manifold and the exhaust nozzle under the influence of the entire airframe. Furthermore, the first stage is divided into two phases to examine this interaction. The purpose of the first phase is to establish a flight technique without conducting an engine combustion test; the second phase aims to investigate the interaction between the airframe and the engine under an engine combustion test.Figure1 shows an overall view of HIMICO, which is used in the second phase of the experiment. In the experiment, HIMICO will be launched by a sounding rocket. The total length of the airframe is 1.5m. This length has been determined by the size of the nose fairing of the sounding rocket. HIMICO has a ramjet engine composed of an intake, a ram combustor, and a nozzle.In the experiment, HIMCO’s velocity reaches Mach 5 at an altitude of 24km. Therefore, the total temperature at the edge of the wing and airframe becomes 1200K. Furthermore, the total temperature behind the engine becomes higher than that of wing and fuselage because of the exhaust gas. Conversely, the temperature within the fuselage must be maintained at 350K to ensure that instruments operate properly. Thus, a thermal protection system (TPS) capable of maintaining this condition is necessary for HIMICO [5].Fig. 1 Overall view of HIMICO.There are many TPSs to be installed in the supersonic aircraft [6]. Heat pipe [7], opposing-jet, and spiked-body [8] are examples of TPSs. In this research, using an ablator is planned because of its simple structure and high reliability. Figure2 shows the ablator’s schematic image. The ablator is a porous or fabric material impregnated with resin; it maintains its interior temperature by endothermic reaction and pyrolysis-gas emission. This material is applied mainly at the tip of the rocket and reentry vehicle and at the rocket nozzle. These areas are exposed to a high heat load from exhaust gas or compressed air. This material began to be used from the Apollo program, and therefore research about ablators starts from that period [9]. However, the thermal protection performance of ablation was estimated by using empirical parameters. Nowadays, because of high computer calculation performance, investigation of thermal protection performance is conducted by numerical investigation. Bianchi etal. [10] and Cross and Boyd [11] evaluated the heat load reduction effect on the rocket nozzle due to the ablator, and Chen etal. [12] evaluated the thickness of the ablator in the reentry vehicle. However, the flow behind the HIMICO engine is complicated by both the external flow and the exhaust gas, and it is difficult to construct a simplified model of this flow. One possible thermal protection system that may be installed in HIMICO is carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), which is a type of ablator. The objective of this research is to consider the feasibility of design requirements by conducting a coupling analysis between heat-transfer analysis on the ablator and CFD analysis on the exhaust gas. In this paper, we first validate the thermal-response code and the coupling code. Afterwards, a coupling calculation is conducted between the fluid and the wall, and the temperature distribution within the wall is investigated.Fig. 2 Schematic image of an ablator.II. Governing EquationsA. Fluid SideThis research uses fluid dynamics governed by the two-dimensional compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation. The k−ω model [13] is used as the turbulence model: ∂∂t∬ΩQ dA=−∬Ω∂∂xj(Fj−Fvj) dA+∬ΩT dA(1)Here, Q=(ρρuleρiρkρω)TFj=(ρujρuluj+pδlj(e+p)ujρiujρkujρωuj)TFvj=(0τljumτmj−qj(ρDi)∂jYi(μ+σkρk/ω)∂jk(μ+σωρk/ω)∂jω)TT=(0000τml∂lum−β*ρωk(αωkτml)∂lum−βρω2+(ρσd/ω)(∂lk)(∂lω))TNote that i is not the dummy index, but the chemical species F and Fv indicate the inviscid and viscous flux vectors, respectively, and T denotes summation of the turbulence generation, dissipation, cross-diffusion term. Equation(1) can be described for the conservation law in each cell: ∂Q∂t=−1Ω∑fNf{(Fj−Fvj)Δsfxfj}+T(2)where f is surface, Nf is number of the surface, and Δsf is the length of each face, respectively. In addition, xfj denotes the component of the unit normal vector in each surface. The variation of Q is calculated by evaluating the numerical flux on each surface.B. TPS SideThe thermal response of the ablator is calculated via a one-dimensional unsteady heat-transfer equation [14] in this research: ρ∂h∂t=∇⋅(κ∇T)−(hg−h¯)∇⋅m˙g−∇⋅(m˙ghg)(3)where ρ is the density of the material, h is its specific enthalpy, κ is its thermal conductivity, h¯ is the specific enthalpy of the resin, and hg and m˙g are the specific enthalpy and the mass flux, respectively. The left-hand side of Eq.(3) indicates the storage rate of sensible energy, while the terms on the right-hand side of Eq.(3) represent heat transfer, energy consumption by the pyrolysis reaction, and convected energy, respectively. Pyrolytic gas is assumed to be calorically perfect and emitted instantly after generation. Based on this assumption, the mass flux of pyrolytic gas is calculated according to the following equation: m˙g=−∫bottomsurface(∂ρ∂t) dx(4)Resin consumption is calculated as ∂ρ∂t=∑i∂ρi∂t=∑i{−Ai(ρi−ρciρvi−ρci)niexp(−BiT)}(5)where i is the number of the chemical reaction that occurred in the ablator, ρi is the density of the resin component, Ai is the pre-exponential coefficient, Bi is the activation temperature, and ni is the reaction order in each component. These Arrhenius parameters depend upon materials. Therefore, estimation of these parameters on CFRP is conducted later. The detailed composition of the pyrolytic gas is unknown; therefore, this gas is assumed to be phenol and its specific heat is set to 2296  J/(kg⋅K).The thermal conductivity of the ablator is evaluated as the weighted average of the char and virgin states. The weighting function is determined by ϕ, which indicates the reaction progress in the ablator: κ=ϕκv+(1−ϕ)κc(6)and ϕ is calculated by Eq.(7): ϕ=ρvρv−ρc(1−ρcρ)(7)The emission rate is calculated in the same way. The values of the thermal conductivity in the char and virgin states are referred to as the reference data [15]. The specific heat of the ablator is calculated according to the Potts formula [16], which is applicable to a carbon-based ablator: Cp(T)=c2TT2+c12(8)Here, c1=800  K and c2=2300  J/(kg⋅K), respectively.III. Numerical MethodA. Fluid SideEquation(1) is numerically solved in this research. H2, N2, O2, and H2O are considered exhaust gases in the conservation law of chemical species. In addition, C6H5OH is considered to be the pyrolytic gas in the coupling calculation. The viscosity coefficient and thermal conductivity are calculated by the Chapman–Enskog [17] and Eucken methods [18], respectively. In addition, the ideal-gas law is used to close the system. The gas is treated as thermally perfect, and the exhaust gas is assumed to be nonreactive.In this report, the convective term is discretized by the second-order Simple Low-dissipation AUSM 2 (SLAU2) [19] method using the Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) [20] method, and the diffusion term is discretized by the second-order accurate central-differential scheme. The matrix free Gauss–Seidel implicit method [21] is used to perform the time integral.B. TPS SideThe chemical parameters of CFRP have to be determined to solve Eq.(5); therefore, the Arrhenius parameters of CFRP are estimated and verified. In this research, data from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) by Suzuki etal. [22] are used. Figure3 shows Suzuki et al.’s TGA experimental result for CFRP; it is apparent that the density of CFRP decreases by 12.9% at 1450K. Thus, the mass fraction of the resin in CFRP is determined to be 0.129. In this experiment, the CFRP temperature increases by 1  K/min; therefore, this mass variation can be regarded as a function of time, and the time derivative of the mass change can be calculated. Figure4 shows the pyrolytic reaction rate of CFRP. Note that the sign is opposite between the time derivatives of Figs.3 and 4; this is because Fig.3 indicates mass loss of CFRP, while Fig.4 indicates the reaction rate. Figure4 indicates that the number of the primary pyrolytic reactions is two. One reaches its peak at 500K and is called “reaction1,” and the other reaches its peak at 840K and is called “reaction2.” In this paper, we assume that the pyrolytic reaction of CFRP can be reproduced by the superposition of these two independent pyrolytic reactions. Figure3 indicates that the amounts of resin consumption by each reaction are 1.6 and 11.1%, respectively.In the following, the Arrhenius parameters are estimated. The reaction rate of pyrolytic gas is described by the opposite sign of Eq.(5). Equation(9) is obtained by deforming the equation about the reaction rate of pyrolytic gas: (ρvi−ρciρi−ρci)ni∂ρi∂t=Aiexp(−BiT)(9)By replacing the left-hand side of Eq.(9) with Ki and taking the logarithm of Eq.(9), Eq.(10) is obtained: lnKi=−BiT+lnAi(10)Fig. 3 Thermogravimetric analysis on CFRP by Suzuki etal. [22].Fig. 4 Pyrolytic reaction rate of CFRP.Equation(10) indicates that the relationship between the inverse of temperature T and the corresponding lnKi value is linear. Therefore, Ai and Bi can be obtained from the section and the slope of the approximate line, respectively. Figure5 shows the Arrhenius plot and approximate line in each reaction. The equation and R value in Fig.5 indicate the equation of the approximate line and the correlation coefficient, respectively. The value of ni is set explicitly between −100 and 100 and determined when the correlation coefficient R is the largest. Figure5 indicates that an accurate approximate line is obtained by selecting proper values of ni in both reactions. The obtained Arrhenius parameters Ai, Bi, and ni from Fig.5 are listed in Table1.The pyrolytic reaction calculation is conducted using the Arrhenius parameter obtained in the previous step. Figure6 compares the experimental and calculation results. Figure6a indicates that although the calculated reaction rate overestimates the experimental result, the peak position shows good agreement. Figure6b indicates that the pyrolytic reaction is evaluated steeply, and the amount of mass decrease is evaluated largely at 840K in the calculation result. However, the error between the experimental and calculation results is so small that the Arrhenius parameter obtained in this research can capture the actual phenomenon.Fig. 5 Arrhenius plot and approximate line in each pyrolytic reaction.Fig. 6 Comparison between the experimental and calculation results.C. Coupling CalculationThe interaction between the fluid and the wall must be considered in the rear part of HIMICO. One of the most important phenomena in this research is heat transfer between the fluid and the wall. To investigate the temperature distribution within the wall during the experiment, this effect must be reproduced by conducting a coupling calculation between the fluid and the wall. However, such a calculation has a very high cost, because the fluid time step is so small that the number of iterations will become very large. Thus, the coupling calculation assumes that the flowfield converges much faster than transitional heat transfer. The calculation method presented in [23] can hold for this assumption. An illustration of the procedure is shown in Fig.7. Firstly, the temperature distribution in the wall is assumed (0 in Fig.7). Next, a fluid calculation is conducted using the wall-surface temperature Tw (1 in Fig.7). This calculation continues until convergence, and then the steady heat flux is calculated on the wall qcnv (2 in Fig.7). The obtained heat flux on the wall qcnv is used in the heat-transfer calculation as a boundary condition (3 in Fig.7). After fluid calculation, a heat-transfer calculation is conducted (4 in Fig.7), which continues for Δtc and updates the temperature distribution in the wall. After the heat-transfer calculation, a fluid calculation is again conducted using the updated wall temperature. The coupling calculation is done by repeating this procedure.Information exchange between the fluid and heat-transfer calculations takes place through the wall’s surface. The surface temperature Tw and heat flux on the wall qcnv are determined from the state of both the fluid and the wall. Figure8 shows a schematic image of the boundary condition on the wall surface, and Δx in Fig.8 indicates the grid width in the heat-transfer calculation. As discretization is conducted using the cell-center method, the grid point is located at the surface. The heat budget of the following equation holds in the control volume shown by the broken red line in Fig.8: ρ∂h(T)∂t=(qcnv+qdif−qchem−qrad−qcnd)/(Δx2)(11)where qcnv, qdif, qchem, qrad, and qcnd indicate heat convection from the fluid, energy convection by diffusion, energy transfer by pyrolysis gas from the ablator, radiation from the surface wall, and heat conduction into the wall, respectively. By determining these values in each step and calculating Eq.(11), we can calculate the surface temperature of the wall. Therefore, wall-heat convection obtained from the fluid calculation is used to evaluate wall temperature Tw in the heat-transfer calculation.Fig. 7 Coupling-calculation procedure [19].Fig. 8 Schematic image of the boundary condition in the coupling calculation.IV. Results and DiscussionA. Validation of the Coupling CalculationWe begin by validating the coupling calculation. The target for comparison is the experiment with a two-dimensional cylinder in hypersonic flow, as conducted by Wieting [24]. In the experiment, a hollow cylinder of thickness 12.7mm is located in a hypersonic wind tunnel. The Mach number, static pressure, and static temperature from the wind tunnel are 6.47, 648Pa, and 241.5K, respectively. The Mach number of the inflows is so high that the effect of compressibility upon turbulence must be considered in this calculation target. Therefore, the compressibility correction proposed by Tang and Gao [25] is added to the turbulence calculation. The surface temperature and heat flux are measured during the experiment. Figure9 shows the calculation domain and boundary condition about this target. The number of cells is about 85,000, and the minimum grid width to normal direction is 0.1  μm. In this grid, the value of y+ in the stagnation point is 1.6×10−3. From this calculation, this grid has sufficient resolution. Conversely, the number of cells in the heat-transfer calculation is about 24,000, and the grid width is uniformly set to 0.1  μm. The inflow condition is adjusted to match that of the experiment, and the inflowing chemical species is set to air. The material of the hollow cylinder is set to SUS321 [26]. The density, heat-conduction rate, and specific heat of SUS321 are constant at 8030  kg/m3, 16.24  W/(m⋅K), and 502.4  J/(kg⋅K), respectively. The initial flow condition is steady when the material wall temperature is fixed at 294.4K. The coupling interval Δtc is set to 0.5s, which has the same value as in previous research [23].Figure10 shows the temperature distribution on the surface of the hollow cylinder when t=5  s. The experimental result [24] and calculation by Zhang etal. [23] are also shown. Compared with the result of previous research, the present calculation better reproduces the surface temperature distribution on the wall. Previous research neglected the turbulence effect in the governing equation. Conversely, the present calculation considers the turbulence effect, allowing the turbulence-heat conduction to be reproduced. This is why the present calculation finds a surface temperature that is closer to the experimental result. Although the present calculation result underestimates the temperature at the stagnation point at 20K, the effect upon the temperature distribution in the wall is small. Thus, the validity of the coupling calculation is concluded to be sufficient in this research.Fig. 9 Calculation domain and boundary condition of the hollow cylinder.Fig. 10 Comparison of the surface temperature on the cylinder between the experiment and the simulations.B. Validation of Heat Transfer in CFRPThe thermal response analysis is conducted, and the validity of the calculation is confirmed in this section. The calculation is validated based on the results from a ramjet combustion experiment, conducted in the Kashiwa Campus high-enthalpy combustion wind tunnel of the University of Tokyo. Figure11 shows the actual setup in the experiment. The ramjet engine is directly connected to the wind tunnel. The total pressure and temperature of the mainstream are 300kPa and 900K, respectively. Combustion occurs in the combustion chamber, and exhaust gas is emitted from the nozzle. Hydrogen fuel is used in this experiment. The fuel-injection time is 5s, and the equivalence ratio is 0.55. Temperature measurement at the nozzle is conducted in this experiment. Figure12 shows temperature measurement points in the experiment. Temperature is measured 28 and 58mm away from the engine. The location close to the engine is called “upstream” while the other is called “downstream.” The surface temperature, interface temperature between the surface and adjacent materials, and bottom temperature are measured at each location. The external nozzle materials are CFRP, Inconel625, Cork, and SUS304 from the surface inward. Figure13 shows the upstream temperature history, as obtained experimentally. The time at which the fluid from the wind tunnel touches the surface of the external nozzle in Fig.13 is indicated by t=0. Fluid from the wind tunnel heats gradually, and the surface temperature reaches 400K before combustion. Surface temperature increases rapidly after combustion by exhaust gas. The interface temperature increases because of heat conduction from the surface.Equation(3) is used to calculate heat-transfer analysis. The diffusion term is discretized by a second-order central-differential scheme. The second-order Crank–Nicolson method is used for time integration. The calculation target is the same as the external nozzle used experimentally. The thickness of each material is 3.07, 7.15, 3.07, and 7.15mm from the surface inward. The thermal properties of Inconel 625, Cork, and SUS304 are referred to as reference data [27–29]. The boundary condition at the surface is set to the temperature obtained experimentally. Conversely, the boundary condition at the bottom is an adiabatic wall. The number of the grid points is 162, and they are arranged uniformly. The initial condition is calculated under the assumption that the temperature distribution is steady when calculation starts. Figure14 shows the initial temperature distribution on the external nozzle.Fig. 11 Setup of the direct-connection combustion test.Fig. 12 Temperature measurement points in the experiment.Fig. 13 Experimentally obtained temperature history.Figure15 compares the calculation and experimental results at the interface temperature and indicates that the calculation result overestimates the interface temperature by less than 0.5K at t=77.6  s when minimum grid width is 125  μm. Calculation can capture the thermal-response tendency on the external nozzle, meaning the calculation is valid when minimum grid width is 125  μm.Fig. 14 Initial temperature distribution in the external nozzle.Fig. 15 Comparison between calculation and experiment in terms of interface temperature.C. Coupling Calculation with Fluid and Heat TransferIn this section, the coupling calculation is performed with fluid and heat transfer. The calculation target is the rear part of HIMICO. Figure16 shows the calculation domain and boundary condition of the fluid. The minimum grid width is 1  μm near the wall. The initial condition of the coupling calculation is steady when the TPS wall is fixed at 300K. The molar ratios and incoming-flow conditions are listed in Tables2 and 3, respectively. The external flow is assumed to be air at an altitude of 24km, and the molar ratio is set to N2:O2=0.79:0.21.One-dimensional (1-D) heat-transfer calculation is conducted to assess temperature distribution more dangerous side. The number of grid points in TPS is 265×162, and the grid width is uniformly set to 0.125mm. The external nozzle materials are CFRP, Inconel625, Cork, and SUS304 from the surface inward, having thicknesses of 3, 7, 3, and 7, respectively. The thermal properties of CFRP, Inconel 625, Cork, and SUS304 are taken from reference data [27–29]. The initial condition of the TPS is 300K uniformly, with a coupling interval Δtc set to 0.1s.Fig. 16 Calculation domain and boundary condition in external flow.Before presenting the coupling calculation result, a steady calculation result is shown to discuss the flowfield formed behind the engine. Figure17 shows the temperature distribution in the steady state. This calculation is conducted by fixing the TPS surface temperature at 300K. Figure17 shows that the exhaust gas from the nozzle expands and its temperature decreases. However, gas near the wall maintains a high temperature because of the thermal boundary layer. This high-temperature exhaust gas attaches to the rear of the engine and imposes a high heat load. Figure17 also shows the heat-flux distribution behind the engine at the steady state; this takes its maximum value of 290  kW/m2 at xs=29.9  mm, where exhaust gas attaches directly.Figure18 shows temperature history at xs=29.9  mm with a different time interval Δtc. From this result, temperature history becomes the same as time passed in all time intervals. However, if the time interval is large, unphysical oscillation occurs just after starting the calculation. In this research, the coupling interval Δtc is set to 0.1s because sufficient convergence is obtained.Fig. 17 Temperature and heat-flux distribution at the steady state.Next, the coupling calculation between the fluid and the TPS is shown. The calculation duration is set to 25s. Figure19 shows the surface temperature in the coupling calculation; Fig. 19a indicates that the surface temperature increases over the whole region because of heat transfer from the exhaust gas; Fig. 19b shows the temperature history at xs=29.9  mm, where heat flux takes its maximum value, and indicates that surface temperature increases rapidly just after the calculation begins. Conversely, variation of the surface temperature lessens as time passes. At xs=29.9  mm and t=25  s, the temperature reaches 1100K.Fig. 18 Validation of time interval in coupling calculation.Figure20 shows the surface heat flux in the coupling calculation; Fig.20a indicates that the surface heat flux decreases over the whole region. As noted previously, surface temperature increases during the coupling calculation. The temperature difference between exhaust gas and the TPS surface gradually becomes small; this is why the amount of heat flux gradually decreases in the coupling calculation. Fig.20b shows the heat-flux history at xs=29.9  mm and indicates that the surface heat flux decreases rapidly just after starting the calculation. The heat flux at xs=29.9  mm decreases to 110  kW/m2 at t=25  s. This means that heat flux is reduced by approximately 60% compared with the steady state.Fig. 19 Surface temperature in the coupling calculation.Figure21 shows the temperature distribution in the wall at xs=29.9  mm. Fig.21a indicates that the temperature of CFRP, to which exhaust gases attach directly, increases gradually because of heat transfer from the exhaust gas. Conversely, there is little change in the temperature of the other material (Inconel, Cork, and SUS) over the whole duration of the calculation; Fig.21b shows the temperature distribution at t=25  s and indicates that the temperature in the bottom of the SUS (y=20  mm) is 300.01K at t=25  s. The temperature inside of HIMICO must remain less than 350K, so temperature increase in the calculation is much smaller than the design requirement. Hence, the performance of the thermal protection system is sufficient in this structure.Fig. 20 Heat flux on the surface in the coupling calculation.To investigate the reduction effect of the ablator, the heat budget in CFRP at xs=29.9  mm is shown in Fig.22. The values of each term in Eq.(3), which governs the ablator, are shown in Fig.22. The second and third terms in Eq.(3) indicate the reduction effect of the ablator and correspond to Figs.22b and 22c, respectively. Figure22d shows the x−t graph of sensible energy in the CFRP, which corresponds to the left-hand side of Eq.(3); this means that the summation of values from Figs.22a–22c is equal to Fig.22d. Figure22 indicates that there are two regions in which a remarkable reduction effect is seen in the ablator. The first region starts from t=0.5  s, and the second starts from t=6  s. These regions correspond to the chemical reactions of the ablator, as shown in Fig.4. This means that the first region corresponds to the peak at 500K (first reaction) in Fig.4 and the second to that at 840K (second region) in Fig.4. The reduction effect of the first region reaches deeper than that of the second region. However, as is seen in Fig.4, the rate of the first reaction is smaller than that in the second reaction. Therefore, the reduction effect by the first region is smaller than that by the second. A large reduction effect is expected in the second region in terms of the reaction rate. However, the region whose temperatuere reaches 1000K is small when the combustion duration is set to 25s. Therefore, the reduction effect of the second region becomes larger if the combustion duration increases.Fig. 21 Temperature distribution in the wall.To check the effect of the chemical reaction of CFRP on the heat reduction effect of ablator, the following four calculations are conducted and compared with each other. Figure23 shows the comparison target of the effect of the chemical reaction of CFRP on the heat reduction effect of the ablator. In addition to normal CFRP (w/resin+w/reaction+w/emission), the calculation case without considering the gas emission from the ablator (w/resin+w/reaction+w/o emission), the calculation case without considering both the gas emission from the ablator and the chemical reaction in the ablator (w/resin+w/o reaction+w/o emission), and the calculation case without the existence of the ablator (w/o resin+w/o reaction+w/o emission) are considered. If the chemical reaction is not considered in the calculation, the density change in the ablation has not occurred and the value of right-hand side in Eq.(5) is always 0. Moreover, if the existence of the ablator is not considered in the calculation, the initial condition of CFRP density is assumed to be equal to the density when ablator is fully char state.Fig. 22 The x–t graph of the heat budget in CFRP at xs=29.9  mm.Figure24 shows the comparison of temperature history at xs=29.9  mm. Figure24 indicates that when comparing the results between “w/resin+w/reaction+w/emission” and “w/resin+w/reaction+w/o emission,” the difference of temperature history is little, regardless of the gas emission from the ablator. In more detail, the temperature difference between these two results is 0.1K at best in all times. Here, Fig.25 shows the mass fraction of phenol, which is emitted from ablator in the normal CFRP case. Figure25 indicates that the amount of phenol mass fraction is at most 10−3. The heat conduction rate of the mixture gas is calculated by the weighted average of each mass fraction. Therefore, the amount of pyrolysis gas is so small that the effect of the existence of pyrolysis gas on heat reduction effect is very small in this calculation. In addition, this result shows that the amount of phenol mass fraction is so small that the effect of the chemical reaction near the surface on the heat flux is small if the chemical reaction is considered in the fluid calculation.Fig. 23 Comparison target of the effect of the chemical reaction of CFRP on the heat reduction effect of the ablator.Figure24 also shows that when both the gas emission from the ablator and the chemical reaction in ablator are not considered (w/resin+w/o reaction+w/o emission), the surface temperature is evaluated higher than that of normal CFRP. On the other hand, when the existence of the ablator is not considered (w/o resin+w/o reaction+w/o emission), the surface temperature is evaluated lower than that of normal CFRP. This difference comes from the difference of the heat conduction rate in the CFRP. The heat conduction rate of CFRP is calculated by weighted average from the heat conduction rate of virgin state and char state. From the reference data [15], the value of the heat conduction rate of char state is larger than that of virgin state. When both the gas emission from the ablator and the chemical reaction in the ablator are not considered (w/resin+w/o reaction+w/o emission), resin in CFRP does not make a reaction, and the value of the heat conduction rate is always referred to the value of the virgin state. Therefore, the value of the heat conduction rate is evaluated lower than that of normal CFRP, and the heat is consumed to increase the surface temperature. On the other hand, when the existence of the ablator is not considered (w/o resin+w/o reaction+w/o emission), the value of the heat conduction rate is always referred to the value of the char state. Therefore, the value of the heat conduction rate is evaluated higher than that of normal CFRP, and heat moves to the depth direction. As a result, little heat is consumed to increase the surface temperature.Fig. 24 Comparison of surface temperature history at xs=29.9  mm.Fig. 25 Mass fraction of phenol from CFRP at t=25  s.V. ConclusionsIn this research, a coupling calculation is conducted behind the HIMICO. Before investigating the heat load due to exhaust gas and the temperature distribution within the wall, we validate the coupling and heat-transfer calculations of CFRP, which is installed in HIMICO as a thermal protection system. Firstly, the coupling between the fluid and heat-transfer calculation is validated based on aerodynamic heating on the hollow cylinder. The present calculation result shows that the temperature distribution on the cylinder wall can be reproduced by comparison with previous research. This is because a turbulence model is introduced to the governing equation, allowing the promotion of heat transfer by turbulent flow to be considered in the present calculation. Next, heat transfer in the wall is validated based on a ramjet-engine combustion experiment. The calculated temperature at the interface between CFRP and Inconel shows good agreement with experiment. Finally, the coupling calculation between the fluid and the wall is performed. The amount of heat flux on the surface decreases by 60% at xs=29.9  mm compared with the steady state. This is because surface temperature increases through heat transfer from the exhaust gas to the wall, and the temperature difference between the exhaust gas and wall surface becomes small. The temperature variation in the bottom of the wall is very small and meets design requirements. Hence, the thermal protection system installed in HIMICO offers adequate protection.Moreover, by investigating the reduction effect of the ablator, the effect of gas emission from the ablator on the heat reduction effect is small. Generally, coupling calculations between fluid and ablator need a high calculation cost and complex calculation procedure because of interaction between external fluid and pyrolysis gas. However, this result shows that the effect of pyrolysis gas is so small that the calculation result without considering pyrolysis gas emission can show reasonably adequate temperature history. This result indicates that it is not necessary to calculate pyrolysis gas emission when designing the thermal protection system on the aircraft.Before concluding this paper, several points that were not considered are explained. Firstly, we did not consider the chemical reaction of the exhaust gas. Unburnt hydrogen is contained in the exhaust gas, and, therefore, the temperature distribution may change if this hydrogen burns behind the engine. Secondly, surface recession is also not considered. Recession of the CFRP is not observed in the ramjet-engine combustion experiment. However, the combustion duration is 5s and shorter than the combustion duration in the flight condition. Therefore, surface recession may occur during combustion in an actual flight experiment.S.

        "content": "AbstractThe Mars Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) spacecraft, which successfully touched down on the planet surface on November 26, 2018, was proposed as a near build-to-print copy of the Mars Phoenix vehicle to reduce the overall cost and risk of the mission. Because the lander payload and the atmospheric entry trajectory were similar enough to those of the Phoenix mission, it was expected that the Phoenix thermal protection material thickness would be sufficient to withstand the entry heat load. However, allowances were made for increasing the heatshield thickness because the planned spacecraft arrival date coincided with the Mars dust storm season. The aftbody thermal protection system components were not expected to change. In a first for a U.S. Mars mission, the aerothermal environments for InSight included estimates of radiative heat flux to the aftbody from the wake. The combined convective and radiative heat fluxes were used to determine if the as-flown Phoenix thermal protection system design would be sufficient for InSight. Although the radiative heat fluxes on the aftbody were predicted to be comparable to, or even higher than the local convective heat fluxes, all analyses of the aftbody thermal protection system showed that the design would still be adequate. Aerothermal environments were computed for the vehicle from postflight reconstruction of the atmosphere and trajectory and compared with the design environments. These comparisons showed that the predicted as-flown conditions were less severe than the design conditions.\r            References\r        [1] Tashkun S. and Perevalov V., “CDSD-4000: High-Resolution, High-Temperature Carbon Dioxide Spectroscopic Data-Bank,” Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer, Vol.112, No.9, 2011, pp.1403–1410. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2011.03.005 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[2] Babou Y., Riviere P., Perrin M.-Y. and Soufiani A., “Spectroscopic Data for the Prediction of Radiative Transfer in CO2–N2 Plasmas,” Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer, Vol.110, Nos.1–2, 2009, pp.89–108. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2007.08.026 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[3] da Silva M.

        "content": "AbstractThe co-delivery of a direct-entry probe and an aerocapture orbiter from a single atmospheric entry state is a novel way to include ride-along probes or orbiters on interplanetary missions. This is made possible through combining two technologies: low-cost small satellites and aerocapture. This study investigates the feasibility of this co-delivery method from a flight-mechanics perspective. The availability of direct-entry and aerocapture trajectories from a single entry flight-path angle is assessed for a large range of feasible ballistic coefficients at Earth, Mars, Venus, Titan, and Neptune. Apoapsis altitude, peak heat flux, total heat load, and peak g-load are also quantified across this trade space. A representative scenario implementing closed-loop guidance is presented for a proof of concept, and the trajectory dispersions due to relevant uncertainties are quantified in a Monte Carlo analysis. Passive ballistic impactor or penetrator probes as a secondary mission with a primary lift-modulated aerocapture orbiter is identified as the most promising configuration.\r            References\r        [1] Halt T., Wieger A., Boensch N., Dolgopolov A., Smith P. and Hernandez A., “Smallsats by the Numbers 2019,”  Bryce Space and Technology, Alexandria, VA, 2019.

        "content": "AbstractSounding Rocket One (SR-1), the first flight test of the Adaptable Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT), was performed on September 12, 2018. ADEPT is a deployable aeroshell that is stowed for launch and deployed before atmospheric flight to increase the drag area of the spacecraft. The main objectives of the SR-1 flight test were to demonstrate that the ADEPT vehicle deploys exo-atmospherically and to characterize the stability of the vehicle during atmospheric flight. The SR-1 test vehicle was a 0.7-m-diam, 70°-half-angle faceted sphere-cone and was the primary payload on an UP Aerospace Spaceloft launch vehicle from the White Sands Missile Range. ADEPT successfully separated from the spent booster in its stowed configuration, opened above 100km altitude, and landed in the deployed configuration within White Sands Missile Range. ADEPT was able to reach peak Mach number of 3.1 and was able to show angle-of-attack stability through Mach 0.8, which was the objective of the mission. The aerodynamics and flight mechanics of the vehicle were modeled preflight for performance and range safety predictions. After the flight, the on-board instrumentation was used to reconstruct the flight performance. This paper describes the predictions and postflight reconstruction, and how the predictions compared with the flight data.\r            References\r        [1] Dutta S., Smith B., Prabhu D. and Venkatapathy E., “Mission Sizing and Trade Studies for Low Ballistic Coefficient Entry Systems to Venus,” IEEE Aerospace Conference, IEEE, New York, 2012, pp.1–14. https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2012.6187002 Google Scholar[2] Cassell A., Wercinski P., Smith B., Yount B., Ghassemieh S., Nishioka O., Kruger C., Brivkalns C., Makino A., Wu S., Mai N., McDaniel R., Guarneros-Luna A., Williams J., Hoang D., Rowan R., Dutta S., Korzun A., Cruz J., Green J., Tynis J. and Karlgaard C., “ADEPT Sounding Rocket One Flight Test Overview,” AIAA Aviation 2019, AIAA Atmospheric Flight Mechanics Conference, AIAA Paper  2019-2896, 2019. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2019-2896 Google Scholar[3] Venkatapathy E., Arnold J., Fernandez I., Hamm K., Peterson K., Prabhu D., Empey D., Dupzyk I., Huynh L., Hajela P., Gage P., Howard A. and Andrews D., “Adaptive Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT): A Feasability Study for Human Missions to Mars,” 21s AIAA Aerodynamic Decelerator Systems Technology Conference and Seminar, AIAA Paper  2011-2608, 2011. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2011-2608 Google Scholar[4] Cassell A., Brivkalns C.

        "content": "AbstractIt is essential when planning multitarget missions to rapidly and accurately estimate the velocity increments of target-to-target transfers. An analytical method is proposed to estimate the optimal velocity increment of a multirevolution impulsive transfer, taking account of the J2 perturbation. First, for a phasing problem where the differences in semimajor axis, inclination, ascending node, and argument of latitude at the termination of the transfer are eliminated, two linear equations derived from the first-order necessary conditions are solved to determine the normal components of the impulses. Then, the radial and tangential components of the impulses are determined by solving another two linear equations, thereby eliminating the difference in the eccentricity vector. In a classical debris removal scenario, the proposed method shows better accuracy than previous analytical methods and even a method based on a deep neural network. The computational efficiency of the method is also much higher than that of the existing semi-analytical method. In addition, the estimated transfer process is in good agreement with the exact one in some cases, and so the method shows potential for preliminary designs of impulsive trajectories.\r            References\r        [1] Casalino L., “Active Debris Removal Missions with Multiple Targets,” AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, AIAA Paper  2014-4226, Aug. 2014. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2014-4226 Google Scholar[2] Zuiani F. and Vasile M., “Preliminary Design of Debris Removal Missions by Means of Simplified Models for Low-Thrust, Many-Revolution Transfers,” International Journal of Aerospace Engineering, Vol.2012, May 2012, Paper 836250. https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/836250 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[3] Di Carlo M., Martin J.

        "content": "AbstractAny space trajectories are subject to state uncertainty due to imperfect state knowledge, random disturbances, and partially known dynamical environments. Ideally, such uncertainty and associated risks must be properly quantified and taken into account in the process of trajectory design, ensuring a sufficiently low risk of causing hazardous events. To bridge the gap between the ideal goal and current practice in mission design, this paper extends Lawden’s primer vector theory and develops a solution method to solve the problem of low-thrust trajectory optimization under state uncertainty. The new primer vector, termed stochastic primer vector, provides an analytical open-loop optimal control law that respects a probabilistic path constraint with a user-specified confidence level (chance constraint). A numerical aspect of the indirect method is also extended by introducing a smoothing approach across constraint corner discontinuities, enabling efficient solution methods for constrained optimal control problems. The validity and effectiveness of the theoretical development are demonstrated with two numerical examples, which clarify the behavior of chance-constrained optimal low-thrust trajectories and confirm through Monte Carlo simulations that the designed trajectories indeed satisfy the imposed constraints under uncertainty with the prescribed confidence level.\r            References\r        [1] Lawden D.

        "content": "AbstractElectromagnetic formation flight (EMFF) uses the electromagnetic force to control the relative positions of multiple satellites without using conventional fuel-based propulsion. To compensate for the electromagnetic torque generated alongside the electromagnetic force, in most previous studies, all satellites were assumed to have reaction wheels (RWs) besides electromagnetic coils. However, the RW-loaded angular momentum becomes nonuniformly distributed among the satellites, because the electromagnetic torque usually differs between satellites. Without a proper control scheme, this deviation increases over time, and the RWs become saturated quickly, preventing the attitudes of the satellites from being controlled. In this study, a new controller is proposed that enables the electromagnetic force and torque to be controlled simultaneously. The EMFF kinematics derived from the conservation of angular momentum are used for the controller design. This controller can control n satellites without saturating the RWs, and only one set of RWs is required among all satellites. The combination of the proposed controller with a simple unloading control exclusive to the chief satellite results in the elimination of the accumulation of angular momentum in the entire system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations of the formation maintenance and formation reconfiguration of a five-satellite system.\r            References\r        [1] Skinner G.

        "content": "AbstractIn this paper, a new family of solar-sail periodic orbits with adequate properties for polar observation of the Earth and moon is developed under the simplified but nonautonomous dynamics of the solar-sail augmented Earth–moon circular restricted three-body problem. The novel orbits, termed “distant-circular orbits,” are found through differential correction and continuation and employ a simple sun-facing steering law for the solar sail. A basic coverage analysis shows that one of the distant-circular orbits is capable of providing continuous coverage of both the Earth’s and lunar north (or south) poles with just a single sailcraft at a minimum elevation angle of 14deg and an average range of six Earth–moon distances. Moreover, simple transfer trajectories between orbits of the family are found, so that the sailcraft can switch between observing the northern and southern latitudes of the Earth and moon during a single mission. Subsequently, using multiple-shooting differential correction, all results are migrated to a higher-fidelity dynamic framework that considers, among others, the eccentricity of the moon’s orbit. The perturbations cause the periodicity of the orbits to break, turning them into seemingly quasi-periodic orbits, but it is shown that the coverage capabilities are maintained. Finally, an active control strategy is developed to counteract part of the perturbing effects such that, by appropriately steering the sail, the apparent quasi-periodicity of the orbits is enhanced and the deviation from the unperturbed orbits is reduced.\r            References\r        [1] Tsuda Y., Mori O., Funase R., Sawada H., Yamamoto T., Saiki T., Endo T., Yonekura K., Hoshino H. and Kawaguchi J., “Achievement of IKAROS—Japanese Deep Space Solar Sail Demonstration Mission,” Acta Astronautica, Vol.82, No.2, 2013, pp.183–188. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.03.032 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[2] Johnson L., Whorton M., Heaton A., Pinson R., Laue G. and Adams C., “NanoSail-D: A Solar Sail Demonstration Mission,” Acta Astronautica, Vol.68, Nos.5–6, 2011, pp.571–575. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2010.02.008 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[3] Biddy C. and Svitek T., “LightSail-1 Solar Sail Design and Qualification,” Proceedings of the 41st Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium, NASA CP-2012-217653, 2012, pp.451–463.

        "content": "AbstractThe orbital motion of spacecraft around asteroids is strongly disturbed primarily because of solar radiation pressure (SRP) and higher-order gravitational forces. To achieve stable orbits in such an environment, the implementation of frozen orbits is a promising approach. This research derives semi-analytical solutions of frozen orbits subject to SRP and zonal gravity up to the fourth order based on singly averaged Lagrange planetary equations. Moreover, the stability of frozen orbits is characterized analytically by introducing linearized variational equations, revealing the complex eigenstructures of the proposed frozen orbits. These analytical theories identify several different types of stable frozen orbits, which are further validated via high-fidelity numerical simulations. Consequently, this paper demonstrates the feasibility and intriguing dynamic characteristics of frozen orbits around asteroids.I. IntroductionAsteroids are occasionally compared with time capsules because they are expected to retain information about the dynamic evolution of the solar system. Asteroid explorations might, therefore, give us a clue to the origins of our solar system and life. Understanding asteroids is also important from the perspective of planetary defense. To avoid a catastrophic impact on Earth by mitigating the threat of hazardous asteroids, knowledge about the physical characteristics of asteroids is indispensable. For these reasons, the increasing number of discovered asteroids has led to a growing interest in rendezvous missions. Recent examples are the Hayabusa2 mission to the asteroid Ryugu and the OSIRIS-REx mission to the asteroid Bennu, both of which arrived at the target asteroid and began proximity observations in 2018 [1,2].Rendezvous missions to asteroids face dynamic challenges in the proximity operation phase. First, in the low-gravity environment of asteroids, the effects of perturbations are relatively strong. In particular, solar radiation pressure (SRP) becomes the dominant perturbing source in the vicinity of asteroids with small solar distances (e.g., near-Earth asteroids). Second, asteroids have irregular shapes in general due to their weak self-gravity, forming irregular gravitational fields around them. Because of the SRP and gravity-field perturbations, the orbital motion of a spacecraft in the vicinity of an asteroid is strongly disturbed [3–6].A conventional solution to this problem is to implement frozen orbits, in which one or more orbital elements remain constant even under perturbing forces [7]. Frozen orbits have been intensively investigated for more than a half-century to compensate for secular perturbations exerted on Earth-orbiting satellites due to higher-order gravitational forces, particularly J2 perturbations (i.e., oblateness effect). The critical inclination problem is one example; it identifies the inclination that diminishes the variations in eccentricity and the argument of perigee [8,9]. The resultant frozen orbits with constant apse lines, such as Molniya orbits, can achieve favorable geometric conditions for some types of Earth-orbiting missions. Another example is sun-synchronous orbits, where the precession rate of the orbital plane coincides with the mean motion of Earth, yielding constant orbital geometries with respect to the sun [10]. These frozen-orbit theories have also been applied to lunar and planetary missions [11,12].In later years, frozen orbits subject to SRP perturbations have also been explored, particularly for small-body missions. Examples include terminator orbits, whose orbital planes lie near the terminator plane. This type of periodic orbit exhibits long-term stability even under strong SRP [4,13]. Because of its feasibility and applicability, terminator orbits were implemented in the OSIRIS-REx mission for station keeping around Bennu [14,15]. In subsequent research, the joint perturbation effect of the SRP and gravity irregularity on terminator orbits was formulated and evaluated [16]. Moreover, recent studies extended the terminator orbit family by incorporating both SRP and J2 perturbations [17]. This extension yields another type of promising frozen orbit, which is referred to as an equatorial heliotropic orbit [17,18]. The previously mentioned studies analytically investigated frozen obits based on Lagrange planetary equations (LPEs), allowing a fundamental understanding of strongly perturbed dynamics.In real asteroid-proximity environments, however, higher-order gravitational perturbations other than the J2 perturbation can significantly disturb the orbital motion of spacecraft. For instance, Ryugu exhibits a strong zonal gravitational force associated with the J4 term, owing to its spinning-top shape. To alleviate disturbances caused by the combination of higher-order gravity and SRP, several strategies have been proposed in recent years. One direct approach is to correct the initial conditions of terminator orbits around asteroids by taking into account the J3 perturbation based on the averaged LPE [19]. Other studies have incorporated higher-order, even zonal gravity harmonics, successfully obtaining modified frozen orbit conditions; nevertheless, the solutions were derived based on a doubly averaged LPE, and thus they are not necessarily valid for large perturbations [20,21].For the reasons described above, this research derives singly averaged LPEs considering the SRP, J2, J3, and J4 perturbations to identify semi-analytical solutions of frozen orbits subject to these perturbations. Subsequent continuation analyses demonstrate that several different families of frozen orbits exist, including terminator orbits and equatorial heliotropic orbits. A further important contribution of this study is the analytical characterization of the stability of the derived frozen orbits. The stability of frozen orbits under the SRP and J2 perturbations was evaluated in [17] and then analytically discussed in detail in [22]. This paper extends the previous stability analysis methodologies for the newly derived frozen orbit solutions, revealing distinctive eigenstructures behind the orbital dynamics subject to SRP and higher-order zonal gravity perturbations.This paper begins with a description of the perturbation models used in this study. In Sec.II, zonal gravitational perturbations are formulated based on a shape model of Ryugu. SectionIII derives LPEs that incorporate the SRP and zonal gravities up to the fourth order. Based on the developed LPEs, semi-analytical solutions of frozen orbits are derived in Sec.IV. Subsequently, Sec.V describes the methodology of analytical stability analysis for the proposed frozen orbits and provides some analysis results. These analytical theories of frozen orbits are validated in Sec.VI via high-fidelity numerical simulations based on a polyhedral gravity model. Consequently, this study expands the possible applications of frozen orbits for asteroid missions and describes the intriguing dynamic structures behind them.II. Perturbation ModelsA. Coordinate System and Orbital ElementsTo describe the orbital motion of a spacecraft around an asteroid, the Hill coordinate frame is used in this paper. The Hill coordinate system is an asteroid-centered rotating frame, where the x axis points in the anti-sun direction, the z axis is aligned with the angular velocity vector of the asteroid orbit around the sun, and the y axis completes a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system. A spacecraft orbit is described with six orbital elements relative to the Hill coordinate frame: the semimajor axis a, eccentricity e, inclination i, longitude of the ascending node Ω, argument of periapsis ω, and true anomaly ν. The position vector of the spacecraft with respect to the center of the asteroid is denoted by r, and its norm is defined as r≡|r|. The radial distance and orbital elements satisfy the following equation: r=a(1−e2)1+ecosν(1)The geometrical relationship between the Hill coordinate frame and the associated orbital elements is sketched in Fig.1.As this research investigates orbital motion subject to higher-order gravity perturbations, it is also essential to describe the orbital geometry in an asteroid-fixed coordinate system. The position of the spacecraft with respect to the asteroid-centered, asteroid-fixed frame can be expressed with the radial distance r, planetocentric longitude θ, and planetocentric latitude ϕ. In addition, the inclination and argument of periapsis with respect to the equatorial plane are denoted by i˜ and ω˜, respectively, as illustrated in Fig.1. From the definitions, the latitude and equatorial orbital elements satisfy the following equation: sinϕ=sini˜sin(ω˜+ν)(2)Fig. 1 Hill coordinate frame and associated orbital elements.Let ε be the asteroid obliquity, which is defined as the angle between the spin axis of the asteroid and the z axis of the Hill coordinate frame. Because of the obliquity and orbital motion of an asteroid, the relationship between the Hill orbital elements and the equatorial orbital elements is time dependent in general. However, the geometrical relationship can be simplified when the spin axis is perpendicular to the asteroid orbital plane. Let us assume that the obliquity satisfies either ε=0 or ε=π, resulting in a situation where the asteroid orbital and equatorial planes are identical. In this case, the asteroid spin direction can be expressed by the following binary variable: δε≡cosε={+1(ε=0)−1(ε=π)(3)The perpendicular-spin assumption yields the following relationship from the definitions of the orbital elements: i˜={i(δε=+1)π−i(δε=−1),ω˜={ω(δε=+1)ω+π(δε=−1)(4)Consequently, the trigonometric functions for the equatorial orbital elements can be converted to those of the Hill orbital elements by using the following equations: sini˜=sini,cosi˜=δεcosi(5)sinω˜=δεsinω,cosω˜=δεcosω(6)The assumption that the rotation axis of an asteroid is perpendicular to its orbital plane is not necessarily applicable to all asteroids; however, it is a reasonable approximation for some asteroids. The spin axes of near-Earth and main-belt asteroids with sizes of less than several tens of kilometers are not isotropically distributed and are less likely to lie close to the ecliptic plane [23,24]. For instance, the asteroids Ryugu and Bennu have obliquities of ε=171.6  deg and ε=177.6  deg, respectively, which can be approximated as δε=−1 for first-step analytical analyses [2,25]. The validity of the perpendicular-rotation assumption is demonstrated via high-fidelity numerical simulations that incorporate the actual obliquity of Ryugu in Sec.VI.B. Perturbing Forces1. Solar Radiation PressureWhen the SRP acceleration acting on a spacecraft is modeled as a conservative force, it can be expressed by using a potential function as follows: aSRP=∂USRP∂r(7)where USRP denotes a perturbation function of the SRP. In this research, the SRP force is represented with the cannonball model as follows [26]: USRP=p(r⋅x^)(8)Here, x^ is a unit vector along the x axis of the Hill coordinate frame and p denotes the magnitude of the SRP obtained from the following equation: p≡(1+γ)P0Ad2M(9)where P0≃1.02×1017  kg⋅m/s2 is the solar flux constant, γ is the reflectivity of the spacecraft, A is the projected area of the spacecraft, M is the mass of the spacecraft, and d is the distance between the asteroid and the sun. Note that the shadowing effect is not taken into account in this study.2. Gravity IrregularityThis research employs spherical-harmonic and polyhedral gravity models to express the irregular gravity field of an asteroid. The former model is primarily used for analytical orbital analyses, whereas the latter model is introduced for high-fidelity numerical simulations. The gravitational acceleration applied to a spacecraft is computed from the gravitational potential UG as follows: aG=∂UG∂r(10)The spherical-harmonic gravitational potential is given by the following equation: UG,SH=μr∑l=0lmax∑m=0l(Rr)lPlm(sinϕ)(Clmcosmθ+Slmsinmθ)(11)where μ is the standard gravitational parameter of the asteroid, R is a reference asteroid radius, Plm is the Legendre polynomial, Clm and Slm are the Stokes coefficients, and lmax is the maximum degree and order of the spherical harmonics. Note that ϕ and θ denote the latitude and longitude, respectively. Equation(11) provides a closed-form expression for the irregular gravity field of an asteroid. Among the spherical harmonic coefficients described in the equation, the Jk≡−Ck0 terms, which are referred to as zonal coefficients, are of particular interest because of their predominant impact on spacecraft dynamics. In addition, the gravitational perturbations that correspond to Jk terms are independent of the longitude of the spacecraft position and thus of the asteroid spin phase. For this reason, analyses of zonal gravitational perturbations provide insight into the fundamental structure of the complex orbital motion around asteroids. From Eq.(11), the perturbation function associated with the Jk term can be defined by the following equation: UJk=−μJkr(Rr)k×Pk0(sinϕ)(12)By using this notation, the explicit forms of the perturbation functions for the J2, J3, and J4 terms are obtained as follows: UJ2=−μJ2r(Rr)2×12(3sin2ϕ−1)(13)UJ3=−μJ3r(Rr)3×12(5sin3ϕ−3sinϕ)(14)UJ4=−μJ4r(Rr)4×18(35sin4ϕ−30sin2ϕ+3)(15)The other form of a gravity-field model is constructed based on a constant-density polyhedral shape model. The polyhedral gravity field of an asteroid is computed from the following gravitational potential [27,28]: UG,PH=μV∭VdVρ(16)where V is the volume of the asteroid, dV is a volume element, and ρ is the distance between the volume element and the spacecraft. It is assumed in this study that the gravitational parameter is given; it has the same value as that in the spherical-harmonic model presented in Eq.(11). The spherical harmonic coefficients for Eq.(11) can be converted directly from the constant-density polyhedral potential presented in Eq.(16) by applying the algorithm proposed in [28].3. Solar TideAnother possible perturbing source is solar gravity, which provides the solar tidal force on a spacecraft around an asteroid. The acceleration caused by the solar tide can be expressed as aST=∂UST∂r(17)where UST represents the potential of the solar tidal perturbation, which is given by the following equation [26,29]: UST=N22{3(r⋅x^)2−r2}(18)where N denotes the mean motion of the asteroid. Equation(18) is derived by applying the Hill approximation, which is valid under the following two conditions: the spacecraft–asteroid distance is sufficiently smaller than the sun–asteroid distance, and the mass of the asteroid is sufficiently smaller than that of the sun. The acceleration given by Eq.(17) is combined with a centrifugal force caused by the asteroid orbital motion, which perturbs the spacecraft trajectory in the vicinity of an asteroid.C. Spacecraft and Asteroid ModelsThe physical parameters for a spacecraft and asteroid that are needed to compute the perturbation potentials are provided here. Table1 lists the spacecraft and asteroid parameters used in this paper, which are primarily based on the Hayabusa2 and Ryugu models. The mass, projected area, and reflectivity of the spacecraft presented in the table are used for the Hayabusa2 landing trajectory design [30]. The SRP potential given in Eq.(8) is dependent on these spacecraft parameters.On the other hand, the physical parameters of Ryugu shown in Table1 were obtained via proximity observations of Hayabusa2 [25]. The volume, mean radius, and maximum radius are computed from a shape model of the asteroid. The mean radius R¯ is defined as the radius of a sphere with a volume equivalent to that of the asteroid, which satisfies V=4/3πR¯3. The maximum radius is introduced to define the region where the spacecraft can potentially impact the asteroid. The major difference between Ryugu and the hypothetical asteroid assumed in the current research is their orbits about the sun. The orbit of the hypothetical asteroid is assumed to be circular with a radius of 1AU for simplicity. This assumption immediately yields the mean motion given in Table1.To analyze the orbital motion of the spacecraft, three different gravity models are employed, as provided in Table2. Model 1 is the simplest model and is introduced for an analytical derivation of the frozen orbit solutions. This model is formulated based on the spherical harmonic model, which is given by Eq.(11), with only zonal coefficients up to the fourth order. Although this gravity model represents the fundamental characteristics of the gravitational field around the asteroid, it cannot simulate the longitudinal dependence due to sectoral and tesseral coefficients. Hence, model 2 is defined for numerical simulations as a more realistic gravitational model with fourth-order full harmonic coefficients (i.e., zonal, sectoral, and tesseral terms). Both models 1 and 2 have an obliquity of 180deg and therefore exhibit no seasonal variation in the spin-axis direction with respect to the Hill coordinate frame. Model 2 is expressed as a function of the spin phase, and the adopted rotation period is identical to that of Ryugu.This study also employs a polyhedral gravity model given by Eq.(16) for further detailed orbit simulations. The polyhedral gravity field, which is referred to as model 3, is constructed from the shape model of Ryugu with 49,152 facets [25]. The polyhedral shape model is depicted in Fig.2. The number of facets is reduced from the original shape model with 3 million facets for the sake of saving computational cost; nevertheless, the reduced version of the shape model retains the major global topographic features, as shown in Fig.2. Detailed descriptions of the original shape model and the gravitational field analyses can be found in [25,30]. Another important difference between model 3 and models 1 and 2 is the direction of the spin axis of an asteroid; the rotation axis of model 3 is tilted by 8.36deg compared with a complete retrograde rotation about the asteroid orbital plane, that is, ε=171.64  deg.Fig. 2 Shape model of Ryugu expressed in the asteroid-fixed coordinate frame.D. Magnitudes of PerturbationsThis section discusses the magnitudes of perturbations in the spacecraft–asteroid system. Figure3 compares the magnitudes of the point-mass gravity and perturbing forces, namely, the SRP, higher-order gravities, and solar tide, for different radial distances from the center of the asteroid. The SRP acceleration is obtained from Eqs.(7–9), and its norm is independent of the radial distance, as illustrated in the figure. Figure3 also shows the zonal gravitational accelerations that correspond to the J2–J5 terms, whose potentials are given by Eq.(12). The reference asteroid radius is defined as R=526  m, and the spherical harmonic coefficients are provided in Table3. As previously mentioned, the coefficients are derived directly from the asteroid shape model shown in Fig.2. The zonal gravity accelerations depicted in Fig.3 are averaged with respect to latitude. The solar tidal force is calculated from Eqs.(17) and (18) along the x axis of the Hill coordinate frame.Figure3 indicates that the SRP and higher-order gravities are the major perturbing sources within a distance of 10km. The SRP acceleration is approximately comparable to the point-mass gravity at a distance of 10km, whereas the higher-order gravitational forces become predominant when the spacecraft approaches the surface. One intriguing feature of the gravitational field investigated in this research, which is based on the Ryugu model, is that not only the J2 term but also the J4 term exerts a relatively strong gravitational perturbation. This distinctive feature of the zonal gravitational effect is discussed in detail in the next section.Fig. 3 Magnitudes of perturbing forces for different radial distances.The relative magnitudes of perturbing forces are dominated by physical parameters of spacecraft–asteroid systems. For instance, the SRP perturbation is less dominant than higher-order gravitational perturbations around asteroids with large solar distances and/or large gravitational parameters. A parametric study on perturbing accelerations for different systems is beyond the scope of this research; the readers can refer to [4,31] for the relevant sensitivity analysis.E. Zonal Gravity FieldFigure4 shows the global distributions of gravitational acceleration evaluated at a distance of r=2R¯≃897  m. Figure4a illustrates the gravitational field computed from the polyhedral gravitational potential, whereas the gravitational field depicted in Fig.4b is based on a spherical harmonic model with lmax=10. In these figures, the norm of gravitational acceleration is displayed as contour maps in the latitude-longitude coordinate frame. It is evident that these high-fidelity gravity models coincide with each other.On the other hand, Fig.5 shows the gravitational fields represented with only lower-order harmonic coefficients up to the fourth order. The gravitational accelerations presented in this figure are evaluated at the same distance as those of Fig.4. The gravitational maps shown in Figs.5a, 5c, and 5e are computed with lmax=2, 3, and 4, respectively, using all orders of coefficients (i.e., zonal, sectoral, and tesseral terms); in contrast, Figs.5b, 5d, and 5f are created with only zonal terms, namely, J2, J3, and J4. Because zonal gravitational terms do not depend on longitude, the acceleration maps provided in Figs.5b, 5d, and 5f show axisymmetric profiles. Figure5e exhibits an acceleration profile similar to those shown in Figs.4a and 4b, which is not completely modeled in Figs.5a and 5c. Moreover, Fig.5f demonstrates that latitudinal anisotropy in the gravitational field is modeled well with only zonal terms. From these observations, it is reasonable to take into account zonal gravitational perturbations up to the fourth order to understand the fundamental orbital dynamics around nearly axisymmetric asteroids, such as Ryugu.Fig. 4 High-fidelity gravity models of Ryugu.Fig. 5 Lower-order gravity models of Ryugu.III. Equations of MotionThe equations of motion used to describe the orbital motion of a spacecraft under the perturbing forces presented in the previous section are introduced here. This research uses two types of equations of motion for different purposes: Hill’s equation for numerical analyses and LPEs for analytical analyses.A. Hill’s EquationThis study employs the Hill three-body problem (H3BP) for numerical analyses of the orbital motion of a spacecraft around a target asteroid. The H3BP serves as a reasonable approximation for orbital dynamics in the vicinity of an asteroid moving in a circular orbit about the sun. The motion subject to the asteroid gravity, SRP, and solar tide is described by the following equation [26]: r¨+2ω×r˙+ω×(ω×r)=aSRP+aG+aST(19)where ω=[0,0,N]T denotes the angular velocity vector of the asteroid orbit. Equation(19) describes the orbital motion expressed in the Hill coordinate frame introduced in Sec.II.A. Because the H3BP model given by Eq.(19) incorporates the effect of SRP perturbation, it is often referred to as the augmented H3BP [32]. The first, second, and third terms on the right-hand side of Eq.(19) are given by Eqs.(7), (10), and (17), respectively. The gravitational potential is computed based on either the spherical harmonic model, Eq.(11), or the polyhedral model, Eq.(16). As described in Eq.(19), the tidal perturbation that the spacecraft feels can be expressed as aST−ω×(ω×r).B. Lagrange Planetary EquationsThe orbit of a spacecraft around an asteroid is disturbed by SRP and gravity-field perturbations. The variation in orbital elements can be described by LPEs averaged over one orbital period of the spacecraft. To derive the equations, this section introduces the averaged perturbation functions. The SRP potential given by Eq.(8) can be rewritten using orbital elements as follows [4]: USRP=pr{cosΩcos(ω+ν)−cosisinΩsin(ω+ν)}(20)The perturbation functions for the J2, J3, and J4 perturbations can also be expressed with the equatorial orbital elements by substituting Eq.(2) into Eqs.(13–15), respectively: UJ2=−μJ2r(Rr)2×12{3sin2i˜sin2(ω˜+ν)−1}(21)UJ3=−μJ3r(Rr)3×12{5sin3i˜sin3(ω˜+ν)−3sini˜sin(ω˜+ν)}(22)UJ4=−μJ4r(Rr)4×18{35sin4i˜sin4(ω˜+ν)−30sin2i˜sin2(ω˜+ν)+3}(23)Perturbation functions can be averaged over one orbital period by integrating with respect to a true anomaly as follows [26]: U¯=(1−e2)322π∫02πU(ν)(1+ecosν)2 dν(24)By applying this averaging method to Eqs.(20–23), the following equations are obtained: U¯SRP=−32pae(cosΩcosω−cosisinΩsinω)(25)U¯J2=μJ2R2×14a3(1−e2)32(3cos2i−1)(26)U¯J3=μδεJ3R3×3e8a4(1−e2)52sini(5cos2i−1)sinω(27)U¯J4=μJ4R4×3128a5(1−e2)72{−10e2sin2i(7cos2i−1)cos2ω−(2+3e2)(35cos4i−30cos2i+3)}(28)Note that Eqs.(26–28) are expressed with the Hill orbital elements by substituting Eqs.(5) and (6), which is valid only when the asteroid obliquity is either ε=0  deg or ε=180  deg. Because the J3 potential is not symmetric about the equatorial plane, Eq.(27) is dependent on the spin axis orientation δε.The Keplerian orbital motion of a spacecraft subject to perturbations is described by the following averaged LPEs [33]: dadt=2na∂U¯∂σ(29a)dedt=1−e2na2e∂U¯∂σ−1−e2na2e∂U¯∂ω(29b)didt=cotina21−e2∂U¯∂ω−cscina21−e2∂U¯∂Ω(29c)dΩdt=cscina21−e2∂U¯∂i−N(29d)dωdt=1−e2na2e∂U¯∂e−cotina21−e2∂U¯∂i(29e)where n=μ/a3 is the mean motion of a spacecraft, and the angle σ is defined as σ≡−Nt0, where t0 is the time of periapsis passage. The longitude of the ascending node, Ω, is defined with respect to the sun–asteroid line in this study and is thus subject to a variation corresponding to the mean motion of an asteroid, N, as shown in Eq.(29d) [16].The averaged perturbation function U¯ is given by the following equation: U¯=U¯SRP+U¯J2+U¯J3+U¯J4(30)Consequently, Eqs.(25–30) yield the following explicit form of the singly averaged LPEs [34–36]: dadt=0(31a)dedt=−KSRP1−e2(cosΩsinω+cosisinΩcosω)−KJ31(1−e2)2sini(5cos2i−1)cosω−KJ4e(1−e2)3sin2i(7cos2i−1)sin2ω(31b)didt=−KSRPe1−e2sinisinΩcosω+KJ3e(1−e2)3cosi(5cos2i−1)cosω+KJ4e2(1−e2)4sinicosi(7cos2i−1)sin2ω(31c)dΩdt=−KSRPe1−e2sinΩsinω−KJ21(1−e2)2cosi+KJ3e(1−e2)3coti(15cos2i−11)sinω−KJ41(1−e2)4cosi{2e2(7cos2i−4)cos2ω−(2+3e2)(7cos2i−3)}−N(31d)dωdt=−KSRP1e1−e2{(1−e2)cosΩcosω−cosisinΩsinω}+KJ212(1−e2)2(5cos2i−1)+KJ31e(1−e2)3csci{e2(35sin2icos2i−4)+sin2i(5cos2i−1)}sinω+KJ414(1−e2)4[2{e2(63cos4i−56cos2i+5)−2sin2i(7cos2i−1)}cos2ω−9e2(21cos4i−14cos2i+1)−4(49cos4i−36cos2i+3)](31e)Here, KSRP, KJ2, KJ3, and KJ4 are functions of the semimajor axis, which are given by the following equations: KSRP(a)=32pna(32a)KJ2(a)=32nJ2(Ra)2(32b)KJ3(a)=38nδεJ3(Ra)3(32c)KJ4(a)=1532nJ4(Ra)4(32d)Equation(31) describes the orbital motion around an asteroid under the SRP and zonal gravity perturbations.IV. Sun-Synchronous Frozen OrbitsA. Frozen Orbit ConditionsThis section derives the semi-analytical solutions of sun-synchronous frozen orbits based on the LPEs introduced in Sec.III.B. Frozen orbits are obtained when the following condition is satisfied: dadt=dedt=didt=dΩdt=dωdt=0(33)Given Eqs.(31b) and (31c), the following equation is a sufficient condition for satisfying the frozen requirements on the derivatives of eccentricity and inclination [17,22]: cosΩ=0∧cosω=0(34)Let us assume that Eq.(34) is satisfied and introduce the following two binary variables: δΩ≡sinΩ={+1(Ω=π2)−1(Ω=−π2),δω≡sinω={+1(ω=π2)−1(ω=−π2)(35)By solving Eq.(33) under the constraint of Eq.(34), the orbital elements of frozen orbits can be obtained as follows: [a,e,i,Ω,ω]T=[free,F1(a),F2(a),±π2,±π2]T(36)where F1(a) and F2(a) are implicit functions of the semimajor axis. Let Ω* and ω* denote the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of periapsis, respectively, that satisfy Eq.(36). By using these two orbital elements, the derivatives of Ω and ω can be expressed as functions of the semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination as follows: G1(a,e,i)≡dΩ(Ω*,ω*)dt=−KSRPe1−e2δΩδω−KJ21(1−e2)2cosi+KJ3e(1−e2)3coti(15cos2i−11)δω+KJ41(1−e2)4cosi{e2(35cos2i−17)+2(7cos2i−3)}−N(37a)G2(a,e,i)≡dω(Ω*,ω*)dt=KSRP1e1−e2cosi⋅δΩδω+KJ212(1−e2)2(5cos2i−1)+KJ31e(1−e2)3csci{e2(35sin2icos2i−4)+sin2i(5cos2i−1)}δω+KJ414(1−e2)4{e2(315cos4i−238cos2i+19)+16(14cos4i−11cos2i+1)}(37b)The eccentricity e=F1(a) and inclination i=F2(a) of frozen orbits are obtained by solving G1(a,e,i)=G2(a,e,i)=0.B. Frozen Orbit SolutionsThe solutions of frozen orbits under irregular-gravity and SRP perturbations can be obtained by numerically solving Eq.(36). Because the solution search does not involve numerical propagation, the proposed orbit design method provides semi-analytical solutions of sun-synchronous frozen orbits. When a semimajor axis is given, an eccentricity e=F1(a) and inclination i=F2(a) that satisfy the frozen orbit conditions can be computed. The solution is not necessarily unique, and therefore this section visually explores frozen orbit solutions.Figure6 depicts the contour maps of dΩ/dt and dω/dt, which are given by Eqs.(37a) and (37b), for different inclinations and eccentricities. These maps are calculated with a=1.4  km, Ω=−90  deg (δΩ=−1), and ω=90  deg (δω=+1). The dotted lines represent the zero levels, where G1(a,e,i)=0 or G2(a,e,i)=0 is satisfied. Hence, the intersections of the dotted lines in the left and right panels of Fig.6 correspond to frozen orbit solutions.Figure7 depicts the solution space of frozen orbits on the left-hand side and examples of frozen orbit solutions expressed in the Hill coordinates on the right-hand side. The dashed and solid lines in the i-e map represent G1(a,e,i)=0 and G2(a,e,i)=0, respectively, which correspond to the dotted lines in Fig.6, and the filled markers represent the intersections of these lines. By using this map, the conditions for achieving frozen orbits can be visually identified as the intersections of the dashed and solid lines. Similar graphical approaches for frozen-orbit design were also introduced in past studies [19,36].Fig. 6 Variations in longitude of the ascending node (left)and argument of periapsis (right).It is evident that there are three orbit solutions for this case, as shown on the right-hand side of Fig.7: an ecliptic orbit (top), inclined elliptic orbit (middle), and terminator orbit (bottom). The ecliptic and terminator orbits can be regarded as the extensions of the families identified in past research on SRP- and J2-perturbed dynamics [17,18]. Note that the equatorial and ecliptic planes are identical under the current assumption. On the other hand, the inclined elliptic orbit has yet to be investigated in detail although similar frozen solutions have been  identified in previous studies [17,19]. Because of its large eccentricity, the inclined elliptic orbit impacts the asteroid in the current spacecraft–asteroid system, as shown in the next section; however, it might be a feasible option for other systems with different dynamic parameters.Fig. 7 Examples of frozen orbit solutions under zonal gravity and SRP perturbations.Figure7 is computed for δΩ=−1 and δω=+1. On the other hand, Fig.8 depicts the zero-variation conditions for the other possible δΩ-δω combinations with a=1.4  km. As depicted in Figs.7 and 8, these maps exhibit nearly symmetric profiles about the sign of δΩδω. However, neither of these pairs is completely identical or symmetric owing to the J3 perturbation, which causes gravitational asymmetry in the north–south direction. Figure9 compares the frozen-orbit conditions for different semimajor axes of spacecraft orbits with δΩ=−1 and δΩ=+1. It is intriguing that the locations and number of frozen orbit solutions (intersections of the curves) are significantly dependent on the distance from the asteroid.The authors reiterate that the proposed frozen orbits are solved under the assumption that the obliquity angle takes a value near 0 or 180deg. This assumption is valid for asteroids with nearly perpendicular spin axes (refer to Sec.VI). However, when the rotation axis is tilted, the proposed frozen obit solutions can exhibit significant temporal variations depending on the obliquity angles. One possible approach to this problem, which would be an intriguing topic for future research, is the implementation of initially or yearly frozen orbits, as recently demonstrated for the J2-perturbed dynamics [31].Fig. 8 Frozen-orbit conditions for different longitudes of the ascending node and arguments of periapsis.Fig. 9 Frozen-orbit conditions for different semimajor axes.C. Continuation of Frozen OrbitsThis section explores families of frozen orbits by applying the continuation method. As shown in Fig.7, several types of frozen orbits can be calculated for a specific semimajor axis. Thus, the families of these frozen orbits can be identified via the continuation approach by treating the semimajor axis as a continuation parameter. The pseudo-arclength continuation is applied for this analysis [37].Figure10 illustrates the transitions of frozen orbit families for four different combinations of δΩ and δω. As previously mentioned, the graphical approach found that there exist three types of frozen orbits in this system, namely, terminator orbits, ecliptic orbits, and inclined elliptic orbits. The transitions of these three families are depicted in the a-e and a-i planes, which is a similar approach to that developed in [17]. The shaded area in the a-e plane shown in each panel of Fig.10 represents the zone where orbits can potentially impact the asteroid, which is defined by the following condition: a(1−e)<Rmax(38)where Rmax denotes the maximum radius of the asteroid provided in Table1.Figures10a–10d indicate that inclined elliptic orbits impact the asteroid in the current system because of their large eccentricities. On the other hand, feasible terminator orbit families appear in Figs.10b and 10c, and feasible ecliptic orbit families are found in Figs.10a and 10c. The terminator orbits can be classified into the northern and southern families, whereas the ecliptic orbits are categorized into the prograde and retrograde families. In this paper, the prograde/retrograde direction is defined with respect to the asteroid orbit around the sun but not with respect to the asteroid rotation. The geometries of these families are summarized in Table4. Note that the δΩ and δω values of the prograde/retrograde orbits are dependent on the higher-order gravitational terms. The ecliptic orbit families depicted in Figs.10a and 10c are similar to the equatorial heliotropic orbit families investigated in [17]. However, unlike the equatorial heliotropic orbits, the inclinations of the ecliptic frozen orbits proposed in this research are not exactly 0 or 180deg because of the J3 term. In addition, when semimajor axes are relatively large (a⪆2  km), this type of frozen orbit is inclined up to approximately 30deg with respect to the equatorial plane, which is referred to as a nonequatorial orbit in the previous study.Fig. 10 Families of frozen orbits obtained by the continuation analysis.As an example, Fig.11 illustrates the families of northern terminator orbits (δΩ=+1, δω=−1), prograde ecliptic orbits (δΩ=−1, δω=+1), and northern inclined elliptic orbits (δΩ=+1, δω=−1) with different semimajor axes. In this figure, the frozen orbits are depicted in the Hill coordinate frame and color-coded based on their semimajor axes. The inclined elliptic orbits shown in Fig.11c impact the asteroid, as predicted in Fig.10b. Figure11 indicates that the continuation method successfully produces a series of orbits of various sizes. These results demonstrate that frozen orbits can actually be achieved even under the predominant SRP and gravity-field perturbations. It should be noted that the solution space of frozen orbits is significantly dependent on physical parameters of spacecraft–asteroid systems, such as the solar distance, gravitational parameter, and spacecraft area-to-mass ratio. Although detailed discussions on the applicability of the proposed method to different systems are beyond the scope of this paper, it should be considered in future studies.Fig. 11 Orbit diagrams of the families of frozen orbits.D. Numerical Simulation ResultsThis section provides some numerical simulations for the obtained frozen orbits to demonstrate their efficacy. In the simulations, spacecraft trajectories are propagated for 80days based on the equation of motion given by Eq.(19). The gravitational potential is calculated with zonal coefficients up to the fourth order, which is defined as model 1in Table2.Figure12 provides simulation results for conventional and proposed northern terminator orbits. The initial condition of the conventional terminator orbit depicted in Fig.12a is calculated considering only SRP as a perturbing force [13], whereas zonal gravity perturbations are taken into account for designing the terminator orbit shown in Fig.12b, as described in the previous sections. The semimajor axes of these orbits are given as a=1.1  km. It is evident that the former orbit diverges because of unmodeled gravitational perturbations. In contrast, the orbital geometry of the terminator orbit depicted in Fig.12b remains approximately constant, demonstrating the validity of the proposed approach.In the same manner, Fig.13 compares the conventional and proposed prograde ecliptic orbits with a=1.4  km. Note that this type of orbit is referred to as an equatorial heliotropic orbit in previous research [17]. The ecliptic orbit shown in Fig.13a is designed to compensate for SRP and J2 perturbations. On the other hand, as introduced in this paper, the analytical model for calculating the frozen orbit presented in Fig.13b also incorporates the J3 and J4 terms. As clearly shown in Fig.13b, the proposed orbit exhibits more stationary behavior than the conventional orbit. This result indicates the importance of the inclusion of higher-order zonal gravities in calculating frozen orbits around small bodies.Fig. 12 Numerical propagations of conventional and proposed terminator orbits.Fig. 13 Numerical propagations of conventional and proposed ecliptic orbits.V. Stability AnalysisThe previous section described the design methodology of frozen orbits around asteroids. It was found that several types of frozen orbits exist, which can be useful for station keeping around asteroids. However, the orbital-period averaging and zonal-gravity approximation applied to solve the frozen-orbit solutions can cause substantial errors in actual asteroid environments. Therefore, to apply frozen orbits in actual missions, orbital stability is one of the critical parameters. This section analytically derives stability conditions and stability metrics for frozen orbits and provides some analysis results.A. Stability ConditionsThe linear stability of frozen orbits can be evaluated based on linearized LPEs [17]. The methodology for analytical stability analysis considering the SRP and J2 perturbations is discussed in detail in our previous research [22]. This study extends the stability analysis scheme for a system incorporating the J3 and J4 gravitational perturbations.Let X≡[a,e,i,Ω,ω]T be a set of orbital elements. By using this notation, the LPEs described in Eq.(31) can be rewritten in vector form as X˙=f(X). Frozen orbits are equilibrium solutions in which the derivatives of the orbital elements are zero. Hence, X˙=f(X) can be linearized around the equilibrium states. Let X* denote a frozen orbit solution, which satisfies f(X*)=0, and let δX≡X−X* be a small deviation from the equilibrium. Then, the variational equation is given as follows: δX˙=∂f∂X|X*δX(39)The 5×5 Jacobian matrix on the right-hand side of Eq.(39) is obtained from the following equation: ∂f∂X=[∂fa∂a∂fa∂e∂fa∂i∂fa∂Ω∂fa∂ω∂fe∂a∂fe∂e∂fe∂i∂fe∂Ω∂fe∂ω∂fi∂a∂fi∂e∂fi∂i∂fi∂Ω∂fi∂ω∂fΩ∂a∂fΩ∂e∂fΩ∂i∂fΩ∂Ω∂fΩ∂ω∂fω∂a∂fω∂e∂fω∂i∂fω∂Ω∂fω∂ω](40)where fa, fe, fi, fΩ, and fω denote the right-hand sides of Eqs.(31a–31e), respectively. The explicit forms of the partial derivatives shown on the right-hand side of Eq.(40) are presented in the Appendix.

The characteristic equation for eigenvalues λ associated with the variational equation has the following form: λ(λ4+αλ2+β)=0(43)where α=−(JAJE+JBJH+JCJI)(44a)β=JAJC(JEJI−JFJH)(44b)An intriguing feature of the characteristic equation is that it possesses a biquadratic form, thereby yielding analytical solutions of the eigenvalues. For the orbital motion to exhibit Lyapunov stability, all of the eigenvalues must have nonpositive real parts. The stability condition is expressed by the following equation: Re(λk)≤0(∀k∈{1,…,5})(45)Given the biquadratic form of Eq.(43), the frozen orbits become stable only when the eigenvalues have a single zero root and two conjugate pairs of pure-imaginary values. Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for Eq.(45) is given by the following equation: α2−4β≥0∧α≥0∧β≥0(46)When this stability condition is satisfied, the eigenvalues are solved as follows: λ=0,±iq1,±iq2(47)where q1=α−α2−4β2,q2=α+α2−4β2(48)In the special case where the gravity-field perturbation is negligible, the following equation holds true: KSRP≠0,KJ2=KJ3=KJ4=0⇒JF=0,JAJE<0,JBJH≤0,JCJI≤0⇒α>0,β=0(49)On the other hand, the J2-perturbed dynamics without any other perturbations satisfies the following equation: KJ2≠0,KSRP=KJ3=KJ4=0⇒JA=JB=JC=0⇒α=β=0(50)Equations(49) and (50) indicate that when either SRP or J2 perturbation is the only perturbing force, which is often assumed in the conventional frozen-orbit design, the stability condition [Eq.(46)] is always satisfied. In contrast, frozen orbits can be unstable when both SRP and gravity-field perturbations are predominant, as discussed in the next section. This finding indicates that the coupling effect of SRP and gravity irregularity destabilizes the orbital motion.B. Stability Modes and BifurcationsThe stability behaviors of frozen orbits subject to SRP and zonal gravity perturbations can be comprehensively assessed based on their eigenstructures. Equation(43) indicates that this system has one trivial zero root and two conjugate pairs of eigenvalues. Each pair of eigenvalues are real numbers, pure imaginary numbers, or complex numbers. The eigenvalue configuration can be categorized into one of several groups depending on the α and β values defined in Eqs.(44a) and (44b). As stated in previous research on general dynamic systems, a fourth-order reversible system, which is expressed as a biquadratic equation, has four different stability modes [38,39]. The classification can be visualized in the two-dimensional α-β plane, which is divided into four regions with α=0, β=0, and α2−4β=0. In each region, the four eigenvalues have different modes, as illustrated in Fig.14.Among the four regions sketched in Fig.14, region 1 is the case where the frozen orbits satisfy Eq.(46) and thus achieve stability. In contrast, there exists at least one unstable node in each of the other regions. The types of eigenvalues in each region are described as follows: in region 1, four pure imaginary values; in region 2, two real values and two pure imaginary values; in region 3, four real values; and in region 4, four complex values. In addition, the boundaries between these regions correspond to transitions from one eigenvalue state to another, which involve bifurcations of eigenvalues. The characteristics of the four regions and transitions are summarized in Table5. The naming of the bifurcations follows the pattern proposed in [38]. Note that the trivial zero eigenvalue is not listed in the third column. By using the α-β diagram, the stability transitions of the frozen orbits can be visually identified.Fig. 14 Classification of orbital stability based on eigenvalue configurations.To systematically quantify the stability of frozen orbits, this research also introduces a stability index, which is defined by the following equation: ζ=max(Re(λk))(k∈{1,…,5})(51)Stable frozen orbits possess a stability index of ζ=0. A larger stability index value represents stronger instability, as the eigenvalue dominates the expansion rate of the state error. The virtue of this metric is that it can be calculated analytically without performing orbit propagation.C. Stability Analysis ResultsThis section provides some analysis results for the stability of frozen orbits disturbed by SRP and zonal gravity perturbations. Figure15 shows the stability modes of the three different types of frozen orbits depicted in Fig.11. The orbit transitions are presented in the a-e plane, and the stability modes are indicated by color. The shaded regions in Fig.15 represent infeasible cases defined by Eq.(38), where the spacecraft orbit can intersect the asteroid.Figure15a indicates that the northern terminator orbits can exhibit any of the four stability modes sketched in Fig.14. This distinctive feature was not observed in our previous study, which incorporates only the SRP and J2 perturbations [22]. It can be inferred from this finding that the joint effect of SRP and higher-order zonal gravities forms the complicated eigenstructure of frozen orbits. Figure15b shows that feasible (nonshaded) prograde ecliptic orbits are classified into region 1. This means that these orbits are linearly stable and thus might be feasible options for actual asteroid missions. The stability mode of the inclined elliptic orbits is displayed in Fig.15c, although this type of orbit is infeasible in the current system because of small periapsides. As shown in this figure, most of the inclined elliptic orbits correspond to either region 3 or region 4 and thus are unstable.Fig. 15 Stability modes of frozen orbits.The complex stability behaviors of the terminator orbits are analyzed in detail in subsequent paragraphs. Figure16a depicts the root locus expressed in the complex plane. Five eigenvalues calculated from Eq.(43) for each terminator orbit are plotted in this figure. The colors of the plots represent the semimajor axes of the orbits. On the other hand, Fig.16b shows the transitions of terminator orbits in the α-β plane. The α and β values are obtained from Eqs.(44a) and (44b). This figure indicates that the orbit family crosses the borders of the stability modes multiple times, at the points where bifurcations occur. Figures16a and 16b both demonstrate that the eigenstructure of the dynamic system investigated in this research exhibits complex profiles.The analytical analyses provided in this paper are further validated by numerical simulations. Figures17–19, respectively, depict the stability indices of the northern terminator orbits, prograde ecliptic orbits, and northern inclined elliptic orbits. In addition, some examples of numerically propagated orbits are included in Figs.17 and 18. The propagation results are expressed in orbit diagrams (Hill coordinate frame) and in the time histories of eccentricity, inclination, and the longitude of the ascending node. To avoid singularity for inclination, the longitude of periapsis, Π≡Ω+ω, is depicted instead of the longitude of the ascending node for the ecliptic orbits shown in Fig.18 [7,40]. The orbital motions are propagated based on Hill’s equation, given by Eq.(19), and the gravitational acceleration is computed based on model 2, defined in Table2. In the numerical simulations, the initial Ω and i values are perturbed by 3deg to compare orbital evolutions. The trajectories are propagated for 160days unless the calculation is terminated when a spacecraft trajectory intersects with a spherical asteroid with a radius of R¯. Note that the shaded areas in the a-e plane shown in Figs.17–19 correspond to the cases where Eq.(38) is satisfied. The primary parameters of the propagated frozen orbits are summarized in Table6.Fig. 16 Eigenstructure of northern terminator orbits.Figure17 indicates that the stability index profile of the northern terminator orbits is non-monotonous and that orbits with larger stability indices tend to involve stronger disturbances. For instance, the unstable orbit with ζ=1.2×10−6 depicted in Fig.17a diverges and eventually collides with the asteroid. In contrast, the stable orbit with ζ=0 illustrated in Fig.17b does not experience collision within 160days, even though the orbital size is similar to that of the orbit shown in Fig.17a. A comparison among Figs.17c–17e indicates that a frozen orbit exhibits weaker instability as the stability index decreases. The difference in the growth rates of perturbations is observed in the temporal variations of the orbital elements. One intriguing notion is that a stability index has a local maximum at a≃1  km, presumably because the coupling of SRP and gravity irregularity significantly perturbs the orbital motion in the intermediate-altitude region. The terminator orbits at large distances, such as the orbit shown in Fig.17e, are approximately identical to the conventional SRP-perturbed terminator orbit. Hence, the stability index converges to zero in accordance with the increase in the semimajor axis, as indicated by Eq.(49).Fig. 17 Analytical stability analysis and numerical simulations for northern terminator orbits.Fig. 18 Analytical stability analysis and numerical simulations for prograde ecliptic orbits.Fig. 19 Analytical stability analysis for northern inclined elliptic orbits.The prograde ecliptic frozen orbits depicted in Fig.18 all achieve long-term stability, as predicted by the analytical stability analyses provided in Fig.15b. Figures18a–18c show that these ecliptic orbits are bounded within some regions without collisions during the propagation period. However, the inclination history presented in Fig.18c exhibits slightly irregular behavior. This observation implies that when a periapsis is too close to the asteroid, gravitational perturbations can destabilize frozen orbits.From these observations, Figs.17 and 18 demonstrate that the numerical simulations agree with the analytical analyses, therefore validating the introduced dynamic theories on frozen orbits subject to zonal gravity and SRP perturbations. Although the dynamic asymmetries exist between the northern and southern terminator orbits and between the prograde and retrograde ecliptic orbits, they are expected to be minor given the similarity in the solution spaces depicted in Fig.10.Unlike the terminator and ecliptic frozen orbits, there is no feasible solution of the inclined elliptic orbits that can avoid an impact on the asteroid surface; nevertheless, the orbit stability can be analytically evaluated in the same manner. As depicted in Fig.19, the stability indices of the inclined orbits are larger than those of the other orbit families shown in Figs.17 and 18. This result implies that inclined elliptic orbits exhibit relatively strong instability presumably because of their large eccentricities; however, it does not rule out the possibility that this type of orbit can serve as a viable option in different systems.VI. High-Fidelity Numerical SimulationTo evaluate the feasibility of frozen orbits for actual asteroid missions, numerical simulations based on a high-fidelity gravity model are presented in this section. The terminator and ecliptic orbits shown in Table6 are propagated using Hill’s equation [Eq.(19)] and the polyhedral gravity model of Ryugu, which is defined as model 3in Table2. The direction of the spin axis exhibits seasonal variation due to the orbital motion of the asteroid, and its initial direction vector with respect to the Hill coordinate frame is set to be [0,−0.1454,−0.9894]T. Note that the orbit of the asteroid around the sun is assumed to be circular to simplify the comparison between the analytical theories and the numerical simulations. The numerical propagation is terminated when a spacecraft trajectory intersects with the polyhedral shape model of the asteroid.The numerical simulation results for the northern terminator orbits and prograde ecliptic orbits are illustrated in Figs.20 and 21, respectively. These figures depict the orbit diagrams and time histories of the orbital elements in the same manner as in Figs.17 and 18. The asteroid is rotating with respect to the Hill coordinate frame, and thus Figs.20 and 21 show the initial state of the asteroid. The initial state vectors of the spacecraft are the same as those provided in Figs.17 and 18.The orbit profiles depicted in Figs.20c–20e are similar to the corresponding diagrams provided in Fig.17. The growth rates of perturbations agree with those predicted in the analytical theories discussed in Sec.V. This result demonstrates the validity of the semi-analytical solutions of frozen orbits and their stability characterizations. As shown in Figs.20d and 20e, a spacecraft can naturally orbit around an asteroid for more than 150days even under SRP and gravity-field perturbations. On the other hand, the orbits illustrated in Figs.20a and 20b collide with the asteroid in 33 and 107days, respectively, although the latter orbit is linearly stable according to the result shown in Fig.17. This observation implies that when a spacecraft is located too close to an asteroid, the perpendicular-spin assumption, zonal-gravity approximation, and orbital-period averaging used to derive the frozen solutions lose validity, leading to significant variations in the orbital elements.Fig. 20 Numerical propagations of northern terminator orbits based on the polyhedral gravity model.Fig. 21 Numerical propagations of prograde ecliptic orbits based on the polyhedral gravity model.Among the three prograde ecliptic orbits illustrated in Fig.21, the left two orbits are bounded within certain spatial regions. The orbital elements of these two orbits exhibit simple harmonic oscillations, which agrees with the linear stability analysis. Although the variations in inclination are larger than those shown in Figs.18a and 18b, the orbital geometries remain approximately constant even in a polyhedral gravity field, demonstrating the feasibility of ecliptic frozen orbits. In contrast, the ecliptic orbit shown in Fig.21c, which has a smaller periapsis than the other two ecliptic orbits, gradually diverges and eventually collides with the asteroid in approximately 89days. It can be inferred from this finding that ecliptic orbits with a small periapsis can be destabilized due to predominant gravity-field perturbations, as is also observed for the terminator orbits presented in Fig.20.The high-fidelity numerical simulations described in this section imply that the frozen orbit solutions derived analytically based on the zonal gravity approximation are valid for Ryugu-like asteroids. It can therefore be concluded that the proposed frozen orbits are promising options for asteroid missions under gravity-field and SRP perturbations, particularly for target bodies with nearly perpendicular rotation axes and axisymmetric shapes.VII. ConclusionsThis paper investigated frozen orbits around asteroids under strong SRP and zonal gravity perturbations. First, perturbation models were introduced, and the accelerations due to the SRP, higher-order gravity, and solar tide were computed. This analysis clarified that the adopted Ryugu-based gravity model exhibits strong zonal acceleration corresponding to the J4 term as well as the J2 term. In the subsequent section, singly averaged LPEs that incorporate the SRP, J2, J3, and J4 perturbations were successfully derived. Based on this model, semi-analytical solutions for frozen orbits were obtained, in which the optimal eccentricity and inclination were visually identified using a two-dimensional variation map. The continuation of frozen orbits clarified that three types of frozen orbits exist, namely, terminator orbits, ecliptic orbits, and inclined elliptic orbits. The first two orbits are extensions of previously identified solutions. In contrast, inclined elliptic orbits are not feasible in the current system because of their large eccentricities. One of the major contributions of this research is its analytical characterization of the stability behavior of the derived frozen orbits. It was clarified that the frozen orbits exhibit four different stability modes depending on their characteristic eigenvalues, which was not observed in our previous study that focuses only on the SRP and J2 perturbations. Furthermore, a stability index was introduced to analytically quantify the orbital stability, demonstrating the existence of stable frozen orbits. The developed stability analysis scheme provides essential information for the design of frozen orbits in actual missions. In the last section, the obtained frozen orbits were propagated based on a polyhedral-gravity model to validate the aforementioned analytical theories. The high-fidelity numerical simulations showed that a spacecraft can naturally orbit an asteroid for more than 150days in relatively stable terminator and ecliptic orbits. From these observations, it can be concluded that the proposed frozen orbits serve as feasible options for asteroid missions and involve complex yet intriguing dynamic structures.Appendix: Derivatives of the Terms in the LPEsThe partial derivatives of the right-hand sides of Eq.(31) are derived here.
