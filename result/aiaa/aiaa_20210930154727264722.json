        "content": "AbstractThe Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) spacecraft landed successfully on 26 November 2018 to conduct an exploration of the interior of Mars. To meet NASA’s requirement for communications during critical events, the InSight lander transmitted telemetry continuously throughout entry, descent, and landing. This allowed the public to witness the landing in real time. The transmissions were received by five assets: three at Mars and two on Earth. These included real-time relay of telemetry by the first deep-space CubeSats. This paper describes the constraints on the design of an entry, design, and landing communication link; the uncertainties in the trajectory; and the modeling that was used to meet these constraints. It then reports on the actual performance of each link, including an unexpected degradation of signal to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The lessons learned from this process contributed to the successful relay of data from the Perseverance lander, as well as to the design of future landing communications systems.\r            References\r        [1] Maddock R.

        "content": "AbstractA new method for efficient trajectory planning to resolve potential conflicts among multiple aircraft is proposed. A brief review of aircraft trajectory planning and conflict resolution methods is given first. Next, a new method is proposed that is based on a probabilistic conflict risk map using the predicted probability of conflict with the intention information of the intruders. The risk-map-based method allows the path planning algorithm to simultaneously account for many uncertainties affecting safety, such as positioning error, wind variability, and human errors. Following this, A* algorithm is used to find the cost-minimized trajectory for a single aircraft by considering all other aircraft as intruders. Search heuristic method is implemented to iterate the A* algorithm for all aircraft to optimize the trajectory planning. Convergence and computation efficiency of the proposed method are investigated in detail. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under several important scenarios for air traffic control, such as wind effects, non-cooperative aircraft, minimum disturbance of pilots, and deconflict with flight intent information. Several conclusions are drawn based on the proposed method.\r            References\r        [1] “Policy and Plans: FAA Aerospace Forecast Fiscal Years 2016–2036,”  Federal Aviation Administration Rept.

        "content": "AbstractAny space trajectories are subject to state uncertainty due to imperfect state knowledge, random disturbances, and partially known dynamical environments. Ideally, such uncertainty and associated risks must be properly quantified and taken into account in the process of trajectory design, ensuring a sufficiently low risk of causing hazardous events. To bridge the gap between the ideal goal and current practice in mission design, this paper extends Lawden’s primer vector theory and develops a solution method to solve the problem of low-thrust trajectory optimization under state uncertainty. The new primer vector, termed stochastic primer vector, provides an analytical open-loop optimal control law that respects a probabilistic path constraint with a user-specified confidence level (chance constraint). A numerical aspect of the indirect method is also extended by introducing a smoothing approach across constraint corner discontinuities, enabling efficient solution methods for constrained optimal control problems. The validity and effectiveness of the theoretical development are demonstrated with two numerical examples, which clarify the behavior of chance-constrained optimal low-thrust trajectories and confirm through Monte Carlo simulations that the designed trajectories indeed satisfy the imposed constraints under uncertainty with the prescribed confidence level.\r            References\r        [1] Lawden D.

        "content": "AbstractThis paper investigates a novel method to increase the accuracy of ballistic deployment by controlling the spin rate of the lander, assuming that the lander is spherical. The concept of the bouncing return trajectory is proposed, which takes off and lands at the same point on the asteroid surface. The spin rate of a spherical lander is controlled before each impact to change its postimpact velocity so that it can be driven into the bouncing return trajectory and remains in the vicinity of its original landing site until it finally rests on the surface. First, the properties of bouncing return trajectories are investigated based on a spherical model. Based on the contact dynamics, the analytical solution of the required spin rate to change velocity is derived. Next, candidate deployment trajectories of the proposed method are studied under different asteroid parameters. Finally, the feasibility and robustness of the method are verified using a model of the asteroid Bennu. It is found that the proposed deployment method can achieve a precise landing if the surface environment is ascertained and largely reduce the landing dispersion under an uncertain environment. This paper provides a novel idea for future asteroid lander deployment and surface exploration missions.\r            References\r        [1] Yoshimitsu T., Kubota T. and Nakatani I., “MINERVARover Became a Small Artificial Solar Satellite,” 20th Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellite, AIAA/USU, 2006, Paper SSC06-IV-4.

        "content": "AbstractElectromagnetic formation flight (EMFF) uses the electromagnetic force to control the relative positions of multiple satellites without using conventional fuel-based propulsion. To compensate for the electromagnetic torque generated alongside the electromagnetic force, in most previous studies, all satellites were assumed to have reaction wheels (RWs) besides electromagnetic coils. However, the RW-loaded angular momentum becomes nonuniformly distributed among the satellites, because the electromagnetic torque usually differs between satellites. Without a proper control scheme, this deviation increases over time, and the RWs become saturated quickly, preventing the attitudes of the satellites from being controlled. In this study, a new controller is proposed that enables the electromagnetic force and torque to be controlled simultaneously. The EMFF kinematics derived from the conservation of angular momentum are used for the controller design. This controller can control n satellites without saturating the RWs, and only one set of RWs is required among all satellites. The combination of the proposed controller with a simple unloading control exclusive to the chief satellite results in the elimination of the accumulation of angular momentum in the entire system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations of the formation maintenance and formation reconfiguration of a five-satellite system.\r            References\r        [1] Skinner G.

        "content": "AbstractIt is essential when planning multitarget missions to rapidly and accurately estimate the velocity increments of target-to-target transfers. An analytical method is proposed to estimate the optimal velocity increment of a multirevolution impulsive transfer, taking account of the J2 perturbation. First, for a phasing problem where the differences in semimajor axis, inclination, ascending node, and argument of latitude at the termination of the transfer are eliminated, two linear equations derived from the first-order necessary conditions are solved to determine the normal components of the impulses. Then, the radial and tangential components of the impulses are determined by solving another two linear equations, thereby eliminating the difference in the eccentricity vector. In a classical debris removal scenario, the proposed method shows better accuracy than previous analytical methods and even a method based on a deep neural network. The computational efficiency of the method is also much higher than that of the existing semi-analytical method. In addition, the estimated transfer process is in good agreement with the exact one in some cases, and so the method shows potential for preliminary designs of impulsive trajectories.\r            References\r        [1] Casalino L., “Active Debris Removal Missions with Multiple Targets,” AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, AIAA Paper  2014-4226, Aug. 2014. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2014-4226 Google Scholar[2] Zuiani F. and Vasile M., “Preliminary Design of Debris Removal Missions by Means of Simplified Models for Low-Thrust, Many-Revolution Transfers,” International Journal of Aerospace Engineering, Vol.2012, May 2012, Paper 836250. https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/836250 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[3] Di Carlo M., Martin J.

        "content": "AbstractIn this paper, a new family of solar-sail periodic orbits with adequate properties for polar observation of the Earth and moon is developed under the simplified but nonautonomous dynamics of the solar-sail augmented Earth–moon circular restricted three-body problem. The novel orbits, termed “distant-circular orbits,” are found through differential correction and continuation and employ a simple sun-facing steering law for the solar sail. A basic coverage analysis shows that one of the distant-circular orbits is capable of providing continuous coverage of both the Earth’s and lunar north (or south) poles with just a single sailcraft at a minimum elevation angle of 14deg and an average range of six Earth–moon distances. Moreover, simple transfer trajectories between orbits of the family are found, so that the sailcraft can switch between observing the northern and southern latitudes of the Earth and moon during a single mission. Subsequently, using multiple-shooting differential correction, all results are migrated to a higher-fidelity dynamic framework that considers, among others, the eccentricity of the moon’s orbit. The perturbations cause the periodicity of the orbits to break, turning them into seemingly quasi-periodic orbits, but it is shown that the coverage capabilities are maintained. Finally, an active control strategy is developed to counteract part of the perturbing effects such that, by appropriately steering the sail, the apparent quasi-periodicity of the orbits is enhanced and the deviation from the unperturbed orbits is reduced.\r            References\r        [1] Tsuda Y., Mori O., Funase R., Sawada H., Yamamoto T., Saiki T., Endo T., Yonekura K., Hoshino H. and Kawaguchi J., “Achievement of IKAROS—Japanese Deep Space Solar Sail Demonstration Mission,” Acta Astronautica, Vol.82, No.2, 2013, pp.183–188. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.03.032 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[2] Johnson L., Whorton M., Heaton A., Pinson R., Laue G. and Adams C., “NanoSail-D: A Solar Sail Demonstration Mission,” Acta Astronautica, Vol.68, Nos.5–6, 2011, pp.571–575. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2010.02.008 CrossrefGoogle Scholar[3] Biddy C. and Svitek T., “LightSail-1 Solar Sail Design and Qualification,” Proceedings of the 41st Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium, NASA CP-2012-217653, 2012, pp.451–463.

        "content": "AbstractThe orbital motion of spacecraft around asteroids is strongly disturbed primarily because of solar radiation pressure (SRP) and higher-order gravitational forces. To achieve stable orbits in such an environment, the implementation of frozen orbits is a promising approach. This research derives semi-analytical solutions of frozen orbits subject to SRP and zonal gravity up to the fourth order based on singly averaged Lagrange planetary equations. Moreover, the stability of frozen orbits is characterized analytically by introducing linearized variational equations, revealing the complex eigenstructures of the proposed frozen orbits. These analytical theories identify several different types of stable frozen orbits, which are further validated via high-fidelity numerical simulations. Consequently, this paper demonstrates the feasibility and intriguing dynamic characteristics of frozen orbits around asteroids.I. IntroductionAsteroids are occasionally compared with time capsules because they are expected to retain information about the dynamic evolution of the solar system. Asteroid explorations might, therefore, give us a clue to the origins of our solar system and life. Understanding asteroids is also important from the perspective of planetary defense. To avoid a catastrophic impact on Earth by mitigating the threat of hazardous asteroids, knowledge about the physical characteristics of asteroids is indispensable. For these reasons, the increasing number of discovered asteroids has led to a growing interest in rendezvous missions. Recent examples are the Hayabusa2 mission to the asteroid Ryugu and the OSIRIS-REx mission to the asteroid Bennu, both of which arrived at the target asteroid and began proximity observations in 2018 [1,2].Rendezvous missions to asteroids face dynamic challenges in the proximity operation phase. First, in the low-gravity environment of asteroids, the effects of perturbations are relatively strong. In particular, solar radiation pressure (SRP) becomes the dominant perturbing source in the vicinity of asteroids with small solar distances (e.g., near-Earth asteroids). Second, asteroids have irregular shapes in general due to their weak self-gravity, forming irregular gravitational fields around them. Because of the SRP and gravity-field perturbations, the orbital motion of a spacecraft in the vicinity of an asteroid is strongly disturbed [3–6].A conventional solution to this problem is to implement frozen orbits, in which one or more orbital elements remain constant even under perturbing forces [7]. Frozen orbits have been intensively investigated for more than a half-century to compensate for secular perturbations exerted on Earth-orbiting satellites due to higher-order gravitational forces, particularly J2 perturbations (i.e., oblateness effect). The critical inclination problem is one example; it identifies the inclination that diminishes the variations in eccentricity and the argument of perigee [8,9]. The resultant frozen orbits with constant apse lines, such as Molniya orbits, can achieve favorable geometric conditions for some types of Earth-orbiting missions. Another example is sun-synchronous orbits, where the precession rate of the orbital plane coincides with the mean motion of Earth, yielding constant orbital geometries with respect to the sun [10]. These frozen-orbit theories have also been applied to lunar and planetary missions [11,12].In later years, frozen orbits subject to SRP perturbations have also been explored, particularly for small-body missions. Examples include terminator orbits, whose orbital planes lie near the terminator plane. This type of periodic orbit exhibits long-term stability even under strong SRP [4,13]. Because of its feasibility and applicability, terminator orbits were implemented in the OSIRIS-REx mission for station keeping around Bennu [14,15]. In subsequent research, the joint perturbation effect of the SRP and gravity irregularity on terminator orbits was formulated and evaluated [16]. Moreover, recent studies extended the terminator orbit family by incorporating both SRP and J2 perturbations [17]. This extension yields another type of promising frozen orbit, which is referred to as an equatorial heliotropic orbit [17,18]. The previously mentioned studies analytically investigated frozen obits based on Lagrange planetary equations (LPEs), allowing a fundamental understanding of strongly perturbed dynamics.In real asteroid-proximity environments, however, higher-order gravitational perturbations other than the J2 perturbation can significantly disturb the orbital motion of spacecraft. For instance, Ryugu exhibits a strong zonal gravitational force associated with the J4 term, owing to its spinning-top shape. To alleviate disturbances caused by the combination of higher-order gravity and SRP, several strategies have been proposed in recent years. One direct approach is to correct the initial conditions of terminator orbits around asteroids by taking into account the J3 perturbation based on the averaged LPE [19]. Other studies have incorporated higher-order, even zonal gravity harmonics, successfully obtaining modified frozen orbit conditions; nevertheless, the solutions were derived based on a doubly averaged LPE, and thus they are not necessarily valid for large perturbations [20,21].For the reasons described above, this research derives singly averaged LPEs considering the SRP, J2, J3, and J4 perturbations to identify semi-analytical solutions of frozen orbits subject to these perturbations. Subsequent continuation analyses demonstrate that several different families of frozen orbits exist, including terminator orbits and equatorial heliotropic orbits. A further important contribution of this study is the analytical characterization of the stability of the derived frozen orbits. The stability of frozen orbits under the SRP and J2 perturbations was evaluated in [17] and then analytically discussed in detail in [22]. This paper extends the previous stability analysis methodologies for the newly derived frozen orbit solutions, revealing distinctive eigenstructures behind the orbital dynamics subject to SRP and higher-order zonal gravity perturbations.This paper begins with a description of the perturbation models used in this study. In Sec.II, zonal gravitational perturbations are formulated based on a shape model of Ryugu. SectionIII derives LPEs that incorporate the SRP and zonal gravities up to the fourth order. Based on the developed LPEs, semi-analytical solutions of frozen orbits are derived in Sec.IV. Subsequently, Sec.V describes the methodology of analytical stability analysis for the proposed frozen orbits and provides some analysis results. These analytical theories of frozen orbits are validated in Sec.VI via high-fidelity numerical simulations based on a polyhedral gravity model. Consequently, this study expands the possible applications of frozen orbits for asteroid missions and describes the intriguing dynamic structures behind them.II. Perturbation ModelsA. Coordinate System and Orbital ElementsTo describe the orbital motion of a spacecraft around an asteroid, the Hill coordinate frame is used in this paper. The Hill coordinate system is an asteroid-centered rotating frame, where the x axis points in the anti-sun direction, the z axis is aligned with the angular velocity vector of the asteroid orbit around the sun, and the y axis completes a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system. A spacecraft orbit is described with six orbital elements relative to the Hill coordinate frame: the semimajor axis a, eccentricity e, inclination i, longitude of the ascending node Ω, argument of periapsis ω, and true anomaly ν. The position vector of the spacecraft with respect to the center of the asteroid is denoted by r, and its norm is defined as r≡|r|. The radial distance and orbital elements satisfy the following equation: r=a(1−e2)1+ecosν(1)The geometrical relationship between the Hill coordinate frame and the associated orbital elements is sketched in Fig.1.As this research investigates orbital motion subject to higher-order gravity perturbations, it is also essential to describe the orbital geometry in an asteroid-fixed coordinate system. The position of the spacecraft with respect to the asteroid-centered, asteroid-fixed frame can be expressed with the radial distance r, planetocentric longitude θ, and planetocentric latitude ϕ. In addition, the inclination and argument of periapsis with respect to the equatorial plane are denoted by i˜ and ω˜, respectively, as illustrated in Fig.1. From the definitions, the latitude and equatorial orbital elements satisfy the following equation: sinϕ=sini˜sin(ω˜+ν)(2)Fig. 1 Hill coordinate frame and associated orbital elements.Let ε be the asteroid obliquity, which is defined as the angle between the spin axis of the asteroid and the z axis of the Hill coordinate frame. Because of the obliquity and orbital motion of an asteroid, the relationship between the Hill orbital elements and the equatorial orbital elements is time dependent in general. However, the geometrical relationship can be simplified when the spin axis is perpendicular to the asteroid orbital plane. Let us assume that the obliquity satisfies either ε=0 or ε=π, resulting in a situation where the asteroid orbital and equatorial planes are identical. In this case, the asteroid spin direction can be expressed by the following binary variable: δε≡cosε={+1(ε=0)−1(ε=π)(3)The perpendicular-spin assumption yields the following relationship from the definitions of the orbital elements: i˜={i(δε=+1)π−i(δε=−1),ω˜={ω(δε=+1)ω+π(δε=−1)(4)Consequently, the trigonometric functions for the equatorial orbital elements can be converted to those of the Hill orbital elements by using the following equations: sini˜=sini,cosi˜=δεcosi(5)sinω˜=δεsinω,cosω˜=δεcosω(6)The assumption that the rotation axis of an asteroid is perpendicular to its orbital plane is not necessarily applicable to all asteroids; however, it is a reasonable approximation for some asteroids. The spin axes of near-Earth and main-belt asteroids with sizes of less than several tens of kilometers are not isotropically distributed and are less likely to lie close to the ecliptic plane [23,24]. For instance, the asteroids Ryugu and Bennu have obliquities of ε=171.6  deg and ε=177.6  deg, respectively, which can be approximated as δε=−1 for first-step analytical analyses [2,25]. The validity of the perpendicular-rotation assumption is demonstrated via high-fidelity numerical simulations that incorporate the actual obliquity of Ryugu in Sec.VI.B. Perturbing Forces1. Solar Radiation PressureWhen the SRP acceleration acting on a spacecraft is modeled as a conservative force, it can be expressed by using a potential function as follows: aSRP=∂USRP∂r(7)where USRP denotes a perturbation function of the SRP. In this research, the SRP force is represented with the cannonball model as follows [26]: USRP=p(r⋅x^)(8)Here, x^ is a unit vector along the x axis of the Hill coordinate frame and p denotes the magnitude of the SRP obtained from the following equation: p≡(1+γ)P0Ad2M(9)where P0≃1.02×1017  kg⋅m/s2 is the solar flux constant, γ is the reflectivity of the spacecraft, A is the projected area of the spacecraft, M is the mass of the spacecraft, and d is the distance between the asteroid and the sun. Note that the shadowing effect is not taken into account in this study.2. Gravity IrregularityThis research employs spherical-harmonic and polyhedral gravity models to express the irregular gravity field of an asteroid. The former model is primarily used for analytical orbital analyses, whereas the latter model is introduced for high-fidelity numerical simulations. The gravitational acceleration applied to a spacecraft is computed from the gravitational potential UG as follows: aG=∂UG∂r(10)The spherical-harmonic gravitational potential is given by the following equation: UG,SH=μr∑l=0lmax∑m=0l(Rr)lPlm(sinϕ)(Clmcosmθ+Slmsinmθ)(11)where μ is the standard gravitational parameter of the asteroid, R is a reference asteroid radius, Plm is the Legendre polynomial, Clm and Slm are the Stokes coefficients, and lmax is the maximum degree and order of the spherical harmonics. Note that ϕ and θ denote the latitude and longitude, respectively. Equation(11) provides a closed-form expression for the irregular gravity field of an asteroid. Among the spherical harmonic coefficients described in the equation, the Jk≡−Ck0 terms, which are referred to as zonal coefficients, are of particular interest because of their predominant impact on spacecraft dynamics. In addition, the gravitational perturbations that correspond to Jk terms are independent of the longitude of the spacecraft position and thus of the asteroid spin phase. For this reason, analyses of zonal gravitational perturbations provide insight into the fundamental structure of the complex orbital motion around asteroids. From Eq.(11), the perturbation function associated with the Jk term can be defined by the following equation: UJk=−μJkr(Rr)k×Pk0(sinϕ)(12)By using this notation, the explicit forms of the perturbation functions for the J2, J3, and J4 terms are obtained as follows: UJ2=−μJ2r(Rr)2×12(3sin2ϕ−1)(13)UJ3=−μJ3r(Rr)3×12(5sin3ϕ−3sinϕ)(14)UJ4=−μJ4r(Rr)4×18(35sin4ϕ−30sin2ϕ+3)(15)The other form of a gravity-field model is constructed based on a constant-density polyhedral shape model. The polyhedral gravity field of an asteroid is computed from the following gravitational potential [27,28]: UG,PH=μV∭VdVρ(16)where V is the volume of the asteroid, dV is a volume element, and ρ is the distance between the volume element and the spacecraft. It is assumed in this study that the gravitational parameter is given; it has the same value as that in the spherical-harmonic model presented in Eq.(11). The spherical harmonic coefficients for Eq.(11) can be converted directly from the constant-density polyhedral potential presented in Eq.(16) by applying the algorithm proposed in [28].3. Solar TideAnother possible perturbing source is solar gravity, which provides the solar tidal force on a spacecraft around an asteroid. The acceleration caused by the solar tide can be expressed as aST=∂UST∂r(17)where UST represents the potential of the solar tidal perturbation, which is given by the following equation [26,29]: UST=N22{3(r⋅x^)2−r2}(18)where N denotes the mean motion of the asteroid. Equation(18) is derived by applying the Hill approximation, which is valid under the following two conditions: the spacecraft–asteroid distance is sufficiently smaller than the sun–asteroid distance, and the mass of the asteroid is sufficiently smaller than that of the sun. The acceleration given by Eq.(17) is combined with a centrifugal force caused by the asteroid orbital motion, which perturbs the spacecraft trajectory in the vicinity of an asteroid.C. Spacecraft and Asteroid ModelsThe physical parameters for a spacecraft and asteroid that are needed to compute the perturbation potentials are provided here. Table1 lists the spacecraft and asteroid parameters used in this paper, which are primarily based on the Hayabusa2 and Ryugu models. The mass, projected area, and reflectivity of the spacecraft presented in the table are used for the Hayabusa2 landing trajectory design [30]. The SRP potential given in Eq.(8) is dependent on these spacecraft parameters.On the other hand, the physical parameters of Ryugu shown in Table1 were obtained via proximity observations of Hayabusa2 [25]. The volume, mean radius, and maximum radius are computed from a shape model of the asteroid. The mean radius R¯ is defined as the radius of a sphere with a volume equivalent to that of the asteroid, which satisfies V=4/3πR¯3. The maximum radius is introduced to define the region where the spacecraft can potentially impact the asteroid. The major difference between Ryugu and the hypothetical asteroid assumed in the current research is their orbits about the sun. The orbit of the hypothetical asteroid is assumed to be circular with a radius of 1AU for simplicity. This assumption immediately yields the mean motion given in Table1.To analyze the orbital motion of the spacecraft, three different gravity models are employed, as provided in Table2. Model 1 is the simplest model and is introduced for an analytical derivation of the frozen orbit solutions. This model is formulated based on the spherical harmonic model, which is given by Eq.(11), with only zonal coefficients up to the fourth order. Although this gravity model represents the fundamental characteristics of the gravitational field around the asteroid, it cannot simulate the longitudinal dependence due to sectoral and tesseral coefficients. Hence, model 2 is defined for numerical simulations as a more realistic gravitational model with fourth-order full harmonic coefficients (i.e., zonal, sectoral, and tesseral terms). Both models 1 and 2 have an obliquity of 180deg and therefore exhibit no seasonal variation in the spin-axis direction with respect to the Hill coordinate frame. Model 2 is expressed as a function of the spin phase, and the adopted rotation period is identical to that of Ryugu.This study also employs a polyhedral gravity model given by Eq.(16) for further detailed orbit simulations. The polyhedral gravity field, which is referred to as model 3, is constructed from the shape model of Ryugu with 49,152 facets [25]. The polyhedral shape model is depicted in Fig.2. The number of facets is reduced from the original shape model with 3 million facets for the sake of saving computational cost; nevertheless, the reduced version of the shape model retains the major global topographic features, as shown in Fig.2. Detailed descriptions of the original shape model and the gravitational field analyses can be found in [25,30]. Another important difference between model 3 and models 1 and 2 is the direction of the spin axis of an asteroid; the rotation axis of model 3 is tilted by 8.36deg compared with a complete retrograde rotation about the asteroid orbital plane, that is, ε=171.64  deg.Fig. 2 Shape model of Ryugu expressed in the asteroid-fixed coordinate frame.D. Magnitudes of PerturbationsThis section discusses the magnitudes of perturbations in the spacecraft–asteroid system. Figure3 compares the magnitudes of the point-mass gravity and perturbing forces, namely, the SRP, higher-order gravities, and solar tide, for different radial distances from the center of the asteroid. The SRP acceleration is obtained from Eqs.(7–9), and its norm is independent of the radial distance, as illustrated in the figure. Figure3 also shows the zonal gravitational accelerations that correspond to the J2–J5 terms, whose potentials are given by Eq.(12). The reference asteroid radius is defined as R=526  m, and the spherical harmonic coefficients are provided in Table3. As previously mentioned, the coefficients are derived directly from the asteroid shape model shown in Fig.2. The zonal gravity accelerations depicted in Fig.3 are averaged with respect to latitude. The solar tidal force is calculated from Eqs.(17) and (18) along the x axis of the Hill coordinate frame.Figure3 indicates that the SRP and higher-order gravities are the major perturbing sources within a distance of 10km. The SRP acceleration is approximately comparable to the point-mass gravity at a distance of 10km, whereas the higher-order gravitational forces become predominant when the spacecraft approaches the surface. One intriguing feature of the gravitational field investigated in this research, which is based on the Ryugu model, is that not only the J2 term but also the J4 term exerts a relatively strong gravitational perturbation. This distinctive feature of the zonal gravitational effect is discussed in detail in the next section.Fig. 3 Magnitudes of perturbing forces for different radial distances.The relative magnitudes of perturbing forces are dominated by physical parameters of spacecraft–asteroid systems. For instance, the SRP perturbation is less dominant than higher-order gravitational perturbations around asteroids with large solar distances and/or large gravitational parameters. A parametric study on perturbing accelerations for different systems is beyond the scope of this research; the readers can refer to [4,31] for the relevant sensitivity analysis.E. Zonal Gravity FieldFigure4 shows the global distributions of gravitational acceleration evaluated at a distance of r=2R¯≃897  m. Figure4a illustrates the gravitational field computed from the polyhedral gravitational potential, whereas the gravitational field depicted in Fig.4b is based on a spherical harmonic model with lmax=10. In these figures, the norm of gravitational acceleration is displayed as contour maps in the latitude-longitude coordinate frame. It is evident that these high-fidelity gravity models coincide with each other.On the other hand, Fig.5 shows the gravitational fields represented with only lower-order harmonic coefficients up to the fourth order. The gravitational accelerations presented in this figure are evaluated at the same distance as those of Fig.4. The gravitational maps shown in Figs.5a, 5c, and 5e are computed with lmax=2, 3, and 4, respectively, using all orders of coefficients (i.e., zonal, sectoral, and tesseral terms); in contrast, Figs.5b, 5d, and 5f are created with only zonal terms, namely, J2, J3, and J4. Because zonal gravitational terms do not depend on longitude, the acceleration maps provided in Figs.5b, 5d, and 5f show axisymmetric profiles. Figure5e exhibits an acceleration profile similar to those shown in Figs.4a and 4b, which is not completely modeled in Figs.5a and 5c. Moreover, Fig.5f demonstrates that latitudinal anisotropy in the gravitational field is modeled well with only zonal terms. From these observations, it is reasonable to take into account zonal gravitational perturbations up to the fourth order to understand the fundamental orbital dynamics around nearly axisymmetric asteroids, such as Ryugu.Fig. 4 High-fidelity gravity models of Ryugu.Fig. 5 Lower-order gravity models of Ryugu.III. Equations of MotionThe equations of motion used to describe the orbital motion of a spacecraft under the perturbing forces presented in the previous section are introduced here. This research uses two types of equations of motion for different purposes: Hill’s equation for numerical analyses and LPEs for analytical analyses.A. Hill’s EquationThis study employs the Hill three-body problem (H3BP) for numerical analyses of the orbital motion of a spacecraft around a target asteroid. The H3BP serves as a reasonable approximation for orbital dynamics in the vicinity of an asteroid moving in a circular orbit about the sun. The motion subject to the asteroid gravity, SRP, and solar tide is described by the following equation [26]: r¨+2ω×r˙+ω×(ω×r)=aSRP+aG+aST(19)where ω=[0,0,N]T denotes the angular velocity vector of the asteroid orbit. Equation(19) describes the orbital motion expressed in the Hill coordinate frame introduced in Sec.II.A. Because the H3BP model given by Eq.(19) incorporates the effect of SRP perturbation, it is often referred to as the augmented H3BP [32]. The first, second, and third terms on the right-hand side of Eq.(19) are given by Eqs.(7), (10), and (17), respectively. The gravitational potential is computed based on either the spherical harmonic model, Eq.(11), or the polyhedral model, Eq.(16). As described in Eq.(19), the tidal perturbation that the spacecraft feels can be expressed as aST−ω×(ω×r).B. Lagrange Planetary EquationsThe orbit of a spacecraft around an asteroid is disturbed by SRP and gravity-field perturbations. The variation in orbital elements can be described by LPEs averaged over one orbital period of the spacecraft. To derive the equations, this section introduces the averaged perturbation functions. The SRP potential given by Eq.(8) can be rewritten using orbital elements as follows [4]: USRP=pr{cosΩcos(ω+ν)−cosisinΩsin(ω+ν)}(20)The perturbation functions for the J2, J3, and J4 perturbations can also be expressed with the equatorial orbital elements by substituting Eq.(2) into Eqs.(13–15), respectively: UJ2=−μJ2r(Rr)2×12{3sin2i˜sin2(ω˜+ν)−1}(21)UJ3=−μJ3r(Rr)3×12{5sin3i˜sin3(ω˜+ν)−3sini˜sin(ω˜+ν)}(22)UJ4=−μJ4r(Rr)4×18{35sin4i˜sin4(ω˜+ν)−30sin2i˜sin2(ω˜+ν)+3}(23)Perturbation functions can be averaged over one orbital period by integrating with respect to a true anomaly as follows [26]: U¯=(1−e2)322π∫02πU(ν)(1+ecosν)2 dν(24)By applying this averaging method to Eqs.(20–23), the following equations are obtained: U¯SRP=−32pae(cosΩcosω−cosisinΩsinω)(25)U¯J2=μJ2R2×14a3(1−e2)32(3cos2i−1)(26)U¯J3=μδεJ3R3×3e8a4(1−e2)52sini(5cos2i−1)sinω(27)U¯J4=μJ4R4×3128a5(1−e2)72{−10e2sin2i(7cos2i−1)cos2ω−(2+3e2)(35cos4i−30cos2i+3)}(28)Note that Eqs.(26–28) are expressed with the Hill orbital elements by substituting Eqs.(5) and (6), which is valid only when the asteroid obliquity is either ε=0  deg or ε=180  deg. Because the J3 potential is not symmetric about the equatorial plane, Eq.(27) is dependent on the spin axis orientation δε.The Keplerian orbital motion of a spacecraft subject to perturbations is described by the following averaged LPEs [33]: dadt=2na∂U¯∂σ(29a)dedt=1−e2na2e∂U¯∂σ−1−e2na2e∂U¯∂ω(29b)didt=cotina21−e2∂U¯∂ω−cscina21−e2∂U¯∂Ω(29c)dΩdt=cscina21−e2∂U¯∂i−N(29d)dωdt=1−e2na2e∂U¯∂e−cotina21−e2∂U¯∂i(29e)where n=μ/a3 is the mean motion of a spacecraft, and the angle σ is defined as σ≡−Nt0, where t0 is the time of periapsis passage. The longitude of the ascending node, Ω, is defined with respect to the sun–asteroid line in this study and is thus subject to a variation corresponding to the mean motion of an asteroid, N, as shown in Eq.(29d) [16].The averaged perturbation function U¯ is given by the following equation: U¯=U¯SRP+U¯J2+U¯J3+U¯J4(30)Consequently, Eqs.(25–30) yield the following explicit form of the singly averaged LPEs [34–36]: dadt=0(31a)dedt=−KSRP1−e2(cosΩsinω+cosisinΩcosω)−KJ31(1−e2)2sini(5cos2i−1)cosω−KJ4e(1−e2)3sin2i(7cos2i−1)sin2ω(31b)didt=−KSRPe1−e2sinisinΩcosω+KJ3e(1−e2)3cosi(5cos2i−1)cosω+KJ4e2(1−e2)4sinicosi(7cos2i−1)sin2ω(31c)dΩdt=−KSRPe1−e2sinΩsinω−KJ21(1−e2)2cosi+KJ3e(1−e2)3coti(15cos2i−11)sinω−KJ41(1−e2)4cosi{2e2(7cos2i−4)cos2ω−(2+3e2)(7cos2i−3)}−N(31d)dωdt=−KSRP1e1−e2{(1−e2)cosΩcosω−cosisinΩsinω}+KJ212(1−e2)2(5cos2i−1)+KJ31e(1−e2)3csci{e2(35sin2icos2i−4)+sin2i(5cos2i−1)}sinω+KJ414(1−e2)4[2{e2(63cos4i−56cos2i+5)−2sin2i(7cos2i−1)}cos2ω−9e2(21cos4i−14cos2i+1)−4(49cos4i−36cos2i+3)](31e)Here, KSRP, KJ2, KJ3, and KJ4 are functions of the semimajor axis, which are given by the following equations: KSRP(a)=32pna(32a)KJ2(a)=32nJ2(Ra)2(32b)KJ3(a)=38nδεJ3(Ra)3(32c)KJ4(a)=1532nJ4(Ra)4(32d)Equation(31) describes the orbital motion around an asteroid under the SRP and zonal gravity perturbations.IV. Sun-Synchronous Frozen OrbitsA. Frozen Orbit ConditionsThis section derives the semi-analytical solutions of sun-synchronous frozen orbits based on the LPEs introduced in Sec.III.B. Frozen orbits are obtained when the following condition is satisfied: dadt=dedt=didt=dΩdt=dωdt=0(33)Given Eqs.(31b) and (31c), the following equation is a sufficient condition for satisfying the frozen requirements on the derivatives of eccentricity and inclination [17,22]: cosΩ=0∧cosω=0(34)Let us assume that Eq.(34) is satisfied and introduce the following two binary variables: δΩ≡sinΩ={+1(Ω=π2)−1(Ω=−π2),δω≡sinω={+1(ω=π2)−1(ω=−π2)(35)By solving Eq.(33) under the constraint of Eq.(34), the orbital elements of frozen orbits can be obtained as follows: [a,e,i,Ω,ω]T=[free,F1(a),F2(a),±π2,±π2]T(36)where F1(a) and F2(a) are implicit functions of the semimajor axis. Let Ω* and ω* denote the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of periapsis, respectively, that satisfy Eq.(36). By using these two orbital elements, the derivatives of Ω and ω can be expressed as functions of the semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination as follows: G1(a,e,i)≡dΩ(Ω*,ω*)dt=−KSRPe1−e2δΩδω−KJ21(1−e2)2cosi+KJ3e(1−e2)3coti(15cos2i−11)δω+KJ41(1−e2)4cosi{e2(35cos2i−17)+2(7cos2i−3)}−N(37a)G2(a,e,i)≡dω(Ω*,ω*)dt=KSRP1e1−e2cosi⋅δΩδω+KJ212(1−e2)2(5cos2i−1)+KJ31e(1−e2)3csci{e2(35sin2icos2i−4)+sin2i(5cos2i−1)}δω+KJ414(1−e2)4{e2(315cos4i−238cos2i+19)+16(14cos4i−11cos2i+1)}(37b)The eccentricity e=F1(a) and inclination i=F2(a) of frozen orbits are obtained by solving G1(a,e,i)=G2(a,e,i)=0.B. Frozen Orbit SolutionsThe solutions of frozen orbits under irregular-gravity and SRP perturbations can be obtained by numerically solving Eq.(36). Because the solution search does not involve numerical propagation, the proposed orbit design method provides semi-analytical solutions of sun-synchronous frozen orbits. When a semimajor axis is given, an eccentricity e=F1(a) and inclination i=F2(a) that satisfy the frozen orbit conditions can be computed. The solution is not necessarily unique, and therefore this section visually explores frozen orbit solutions.Figure6 depicts the contour maps of dΩ/dt and dω/dt, which are given by Eqs.(37a) and (37b), for different inclinations and eccentricities. These maps are calculated with a=1.4  km, Ω=−90  deg (δΩ=−1), and ω=90  deg (δω=+1). The dotted lines represent the zero levels, where G1(a,e,i)=0 or G2(a,e,i)=0 is satisfied. Hence, the intersections of the dotted lines in the left and right panels of Fig.6 correspond to frozen orbit solutions.Figure7 depicts the solution space of frozen orbits on the left-hand side and examples of frozen orbit solutions expressed in the Hill coordinates on the right-hand side. The dashed and solid lines in the i-e map represent G1(a,e,i)=0 and G2(a,e,i)=0, respectively, which correspond to the dotted lines in Fig.6, and the filled markers represent the intersections of these lines. By using this map, the conditions for achieving frozen orbits can be visually identified as the intersections of the dashed and solid lines. Similar graphical approaches for frozen-orbit design were also introduced in past studies [19,36].Fig. 6 Variations in longitude of the ascending node (left)and argument of periapsis (right).It is evident that there are three orbit solutions for this case, as shown on the right-hand side of Fig.7: an ecliptic orbit (top), inclined elliptic orbit (middle), and terminator orbit (bottom). The ecliptic and terminator orbits can be regarded as the extensions of the families identified in past research on SRP- and J2-perturbed dynamics [17,18]. Note that the equatorial and ecliptic planes are identical under the current assumption. On the other hand, the inclined elliptic orbit has yet to be investigated in detail although similar frozen solutions have been  identified in previous studies [17,19]. Because of its large eccentricity, the inclined elliptic orbit impacts the asteroid in the current spacecraft–asteroid system, as shown in the next section; however, it might be a feasible option for other systems with different dynamic parameters.Fig. 7 Examples of frozen orbit solutions under zonal gravity and SRP perturbations.Figure7 is computed for δΩ=−1 and δω=+1. On the other hand, Fig.8 depicts the zero-variation conditions for the other possible δΩ-δω combinations with a=1.4  km. As depicted in Figs.7 and 8, these maps exhibit nearly symmetric profiles about the sign of δΩδω. However, neither of these pairs is completely identical or symmetric owing to the J3 perturbation, which causes gravitational asymmetry in the north–south direction. Figure9 compares the frozen-orbit conditions for different semimajor axes of spacecraft orbits with δΩ=−1 and δΩ=+1. It is intriguing that the locations and number of frozen orbit solutions (intersections of the curves) are significantly dependent on the distance from the asteroid.The authors reiterate that the proposed frozen orbits are solved under the assumption that the obliquity angle takes a value near 0 or 180deg. This assumption is valid for asteroids with nearly perpendicular spin axes (refer to Sec.VI). However, when the rotation axis is tilted, the proposed frozen obit solutions can exhibit significant temporal variations depending on the obliquity angles. One possible approach to this problem, which would be an intriguing topic for future research, is the implementation of initially or yearly frozen orbits, as recently demonstrated for the J2-perturbed dynamics [31].Fig. 8 Frozen-orbit conditions for different longitudes of the ascending node and arguments of periapsis.Fig. 9 Frozen-orbit conditions for different semimajor axes.C. Continuation of Frozen OrbitsThis section explores families of frozen orbits by applying the continuation method. As shown in Fig.7, several types of frozen orbits can be calculated for a specific semimajor axis. Thus, the families of these frozen orbits can be identified via the continuation approach by treating the semimajor axis as a continuation parameter. The pseudo-arclength continuation is applied for this analysis [37].Figure10 illustrates the transitions of frozen orbit families for four different combinations of δΩ and δω. As previously mentioned, the graphical approach found that there exist three types of frozen orbits in this system, namely, terminator orbits, ecliptic orbits, and inclined elliptic orbits. The transitions of these three families are depicted in the a-e and a-i planes, which is a similar approach to that developed in [17]. The shaded area in the a-e plane shown in each panel of Fig.10 represents the zone where orbits can potentially impact the asteroid, which is defined by the following condition: a(1−e)<Rmax(38)where Rmax denotes the maximum radius of the asteroid provided in Table1.Figures10a–10d indicate that inclined elliptic orbits impact the asteroid in the current system because of their large eccentricities. On the other hand, feasible terminator orbit families appear in Figs.10b and 10c, and feasible ecliptic orbit families are found in Figs.10a and 10c. The terminator orbits can be classified into the northern and southern families, whereas the ecliptic orbits are categorized into the prograde and retrograde families. In this paper, the prograde/retrograde direction is defined with respect to the asteroid orbit around the sun but not with respect to the asteroid rotation. The geometries of these families are summarized in Table4. Note that the δΩ and δω values of the prograde/retrograde orbits are dependent on the higher-order gravitational terms. The ecliptic orbit families depicted in Figs.10a and 10c are similar to the equatorial heliotropic orbit families investigated in [17]. However, unlike the equatorial heliotropic orbits, the inclinations of the ecliptic frozen orbits proposed in this research are not exactly 0 or 180deg because of the J3 term. In addition, when semimajor axes are relatively large (a⪆2  km), this type of frozen orbit is inclined up to approximately 30deg with respect to the equatorial plane, which is referred to as a nonequatorial orbit in the previous study.Fig. 10 Families of frozen orbits obtained by the continuation analysis.As an example, Fig.11 illustrates the families of northern terminator orbits (δΩ=+1, δω=−1), prograde ecliptic orbits (δΩ=−1, δω=+1), and northern inclined elliptic orbits (δΩ=+1, δω=−1) with different semimajor axes. In this figure, the frozen orbits are depicted in the Hill coordinate frame and color-coded based on their semimajor axes. The inclined elliptic orbits shown in Fig.11c impact the asteroid, as predicted in Fig.10b. Figure11 indicates that the continuation method successfully produces a series of orbits of various sizes. These results demonstrate that frozen orbits can actually be achieved even under the predominant SRP and gravity-field perturbations. It should be noted that the solution space of frozen orbits is significantly dependent on physical parameters of spacecraft–asteroid systems, such as the solar distance, gravitational parameter, and spacecraft area-to-mass ratio. Although detailed discussions on the applicability of the proposed method to different systems are beyond the scope of this paper, it should be considered in future studies.Fig. 11 Orbit diagrams of the families of frozen orbits.D. Numerical Simulation ResultsThis section provides some numerical simulations for the obtained frozen orbits to demonstrate their efficacy. In the simulations, spacecraft trajectories are propagated for 80days based on the equation of motion given by Eq.(19). The gravitational potential is calculated with zonal coefficients up to the fourth order, which is defined as model 1in Table2.Figure12 provides simulation results for conventional and proposed northern terminator orbits. The initial condition of the conventional terminator orbit depicted in Fig.12a is calculated considering only SRP as a perturbing force [13], whereas zonal gravity perturbations are taken into account for designing the terminator orbit shown in Fig.12b, as described in the previous sections. The semimajor axes of these orbits are given as a=1.1  km. It is evident that the former orbit diverges because of unmodeled gravitational perturbations. In contrast, the orbital geometry of the terminator orbit depicted in Fig.12b remains approximately constant, demonstrating the validity of the proposed approach.In the same manner, Fig.13 compares the conventional and proposed prograde ecliptic orbits with a=1.4  km. Note that this type of orbit is referred to as an equatorial heliotropic orbit in previous research [17]. The ecliptic orbit shown in Fig.13a is designed to compensate for SRP and J2 perturbations. On the other hand, as introduced in this paper, the analytical model for calculating the frozen orbit presented in Fig.13b also incorporates the J3 and J4 terms. As clearly shown in Fig.13b, the proposed orbit exhibits more stationary behavior than the conventional orbit. This result indicates the importance of the inclusion of higher-order zonal gravities in calculating frozen orbits around small bodies.Fig. 12 Numerical propagations of conventional and proposed terminator orbits.Fig. 13 Numerical propagations of conventional and proposed ecliptic orbits.V. Stability AnalysisThe previous section described the design methodology of frozen orbits around asteroids. It was found that several types of frozen orbits exist, which can be useful for station keeping around asteroids. However, the orbital-period averaging and zonal-gravity approximation applied to solve the frozen-orbit solutions can cause substantial errors in actual asteroid environments. Therefore, to apply frozen orbits in actual missions, orbital stability is one of the critical parameters. This section analytically derives stability conditions and stability metrics for frozen orbits and provides some analysis results.A. Stability ConditionsThe linear stability of frozen orbits can be evaluated based on linearized LPEs [17]. The methodology for analytical stability analysis considering the SRP and J2 perturbations is discussed in detail in our previous research [22]. This study extends the stability analysis scheme for a system incorporating the J3 and J4 gravitational perturbations.Let X≡[a,e,i,Ω,ω]T be a set of orbital elements. By using this notation, the LPEs described in Eq.(31) can be rewritten in vector form as X˙=f(X). Frozen orbits are equilibrium solutions in which the derivatives of the orbital elements are zero. Hence, X˙=f(X) can be linearized around the equilibrium states. Let X* denote a frozen orbit solution, which satisfies f(X*)=0, and let δX≡X−X* be a small deviation from the equilibrium. Then, the variational equation is given as follows: δX˙=∂f∂X|X*δX(39)The 5×5 Jacobian matrix on the right-hand side of Eq.(39) is obtained from the following equation: ∂f∂X=[∂fa∂a∂fa∂e∂fa∂i∂fa∂Ω∂fa∂ω∂fe∂a∂fe∂e∂fe∂i∂fe∂Ω∂fe∂ω∂fi∂a∂fi∂e∂fi∂i∂fi∂Ω∂fi∂ω∂fΩ∂a∂fΩ∂e∂fΩ∂i∂fΩ∂Ω∂fΩ∂ω∂fω∂a∂fω∂e∂fω∂i∂fω∂Ω∂fω∂ω](40)where fa, fe, fi, fΩ, and fω denote the right-hand sides of Eqs.(31a–31e), respectively. The explicit forms of the partial derivatives shown on the right-hand side of Eq.(40) are presented in the Appendix. The frozen orbits investigated in this research satisfy Eq.(34), and therefore the Jacobian matrix can be simplified to the following form: ∂f∂X|X*=[00000000JAJB0000JCJDJEJF00JGJHJI00](41)The nonzero terms in the Jacobian matrix are calculated from the following equations: JA=KSRP1−e2δΩδω(42a)JB=KSRP1−e2cosi⋅δΩδω+KJ31(1−e2)2sini(5cos2i−1)δω+KJ42e(1−e2)3sin2i(7cos2i−1)(42b)JC=KSRPe1−e2sini⋅δΩδω−KJ3e(1−e2)3cosi(5cos2i−1)δω−KJ42e2(1−e2)4sinicosi(7cos2i−1)(42c)JD=−KSRPe2a1−e2δΩδω+KJ272a(1−e2)2cosi−KJ39e2a(1−e2)3coti(15cos2i−11)δω−KJ4112a(1−e2)4cosi{e2(35cos2i−17)+2(7cos2i−3)}(42d)JE=−KSRP1(1−e2)32δΩδω−KJ24e(1−e2)3cosi+KJ31+5e2(1−e2)4coti(15cos2i−11)δω+KJ42e(1−e2)5cosi{3e2(35cos2i−17)+91cos2i−41}(42e)JF=KJ21(1−e2)2sini−KJ3e(1−e2)3(4csc2i+15cos2i)δω−KJ41(1−e2)4sini{e2(105cos2i−17)+6(7cos2i−1)}(42f)JG=KSRP12ae1−e2cosi⋅δΩδω−KJ274a(1−e2)2(5cos2i−1)−KJ392ae(1−e2)3csci{e2(35sin2icos2i−4)+sin2i(5cos2i−1)}δω+KJ4118a(1−e2)4{e2(315cos4i−238cos2i+19)+16(14cos4i−11cos2i+1)}(42g)JH=−KSRP1–2e2e2(1−e2)32cosi⋅δΩδω+KJ22e(1−e2)3(5cos2i−1)+KJ31e2(1−e2)4csci{5e4(35sin2icos2i−4)+e2(70sin2icos2i+7cos2i−11)−sin2i(5cos2i−1)}δω−KJ4e2(1−e2)5{3e2(315cos4i−238cos2i+19)+1211cos4i−942cos2i+83}(42h)JI=−KSRP1e1−e2sini⋅δΩδω−KJ25(1−e2)2sinicosi−KJ31e(1−e2)3coticsci{e2(105cos4i−175cos2i+66)−sin2i(15cos2i−11)}δω+KJ41(1−e2)4sinicosi{7e2(45cos2i−17)+8(28cos2i−11)}(42i)The stability information of a frozen orbit solution, X*, is encoded in the five eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix presented in Eq.(41). The characteristic equation for eigenvalues λ associated with the variational equation has the following form: λ(λ4+αλ2+β)=0(43)where α=−(JAJE+JBJH+JCJI)(44a)β=JAJC(JEJI−JFJH)(44b)An intriguing feature of the characteristic equation is that it possesses a biquadratic form, thereby yielding analytical solutions of the eigenvalues. For the orbital motion to exhibit Lyapunov stability, all of the eigenvalues must have nonpositive real parts. The stability condition is expressed by the following equation: Re(λk)≤0(∀k∈{1,…,5})(45)Given the biquadratic form of Eq.(43), the frozen orbits become stable only when the eigenvalues have a single zero root and two conjugate pairs of pure-imaginary values. Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for Eq.(45) is given by the following equation: α2−4β≥0∧α≥0∧β≥0(46)When this stability condition is satisfied, the eigenvalues are solved as follows: λ=0,±iq1,±iq2(47)where q1=α−α2−4β2,q2=α+α2−4β2(48)In the special case where the gravity-field perturbation is negligible, the following equation holds true: KSRP≠0,KJ2=KJ3=KJ4=0⇒JF=0,JAJE<0,JBJH≤0,JCJI≤0⇒α>0,β=0(49)On the other hand, the J2-perturbed dynamics without any other perturbations satisfies the following equation: KJ2≠0,KSRP=KJ3=KJ4=0⇒JA=JB=JC=0⇒α=β=0(50)Equations(49) and (50) indicate that when either SRP or J2 perturbation is the only perturbing force, which is often assumed in the conventional frozen-orbit design, the stability condition [Eq.(46)] is always satisfied. In contrast, frozen orbits can be unstable when both SRP and gravity-field perturbations are predominant, as discussed in the next section. This finding indicates that the coupling effect of SRP and gravity irregularity destabilizes the orbital motion.B. Stability Modes and BifurcationsThe stability behaviors of frozen orbits subject to SRP and zonal gravity perturbations can be comprehensively assessed based on their eigenstructures. Equation(43) indicates that this system has one trivial zero root and two conjugate pairs of eigenvalues. Each pair of eigenvalues are real numbers, pure imaginary numbers, or complex numbers. The eigenvalue configuration can be categorized into one of several groups depending on the α and β values defined in Eqs.(44a) and (44b). As stated in previous research on general dynamic systems, a fourth-order reversible system, which is expressed as a biquadratic equation, has four different stability modes [38,39]. The classification can be visualized in the two-dimensional α-β plane, which is divided into four regions with α=0, β=0, and α2−4β=0. In each region, the four eigenvalues have different modes, as illustrated in Fig.14.Among the four regions sketched in Fig.14, region 1 is the case where the frozen orbits satisfy Eq.(46) and thus achieve stability. In contrast, there exists at least one unstable node in each of the other regions. The types of eigenvalues in each region are described as follows: in region 1, four pure imaginary values; in region 2, two real values and two pure imaginary values; in region 3, four real values; and in region 4, four complex values. In addition, the boundaries between these regions correspond to transitions from one eigenvalue state to another, which involve bifurcations of eigenvalues. The characteristics of the four regions and transitions are summarized in Table5. The naming of the bifurcations follows the pattern proposed in [38]. Note that the trivial zero eigenvalue is not listed in the third column. By using the α-β diagram, the stability transitions of the frozen orbits can be visually identified.Fig. 14 Classification of orbital stability based on eigenvalue configurations.To systematically quantify the stability of frozen orbits, this research also introduces a stability index, which is defined by the following equation: ζ=max(Re(λk))(k∈{1,…,5})(51)Stable frozen orbits possess a stability index of ζ=0. A larger stability index value represents stronger instability, as the eigenvalue dominates the expansion rate of the state error. The virtue of this metric is that it can be calculated analytically without performing orbit propagation.C. Stability Analysis ResultsThis section provides some analysis results for the stability of frozen orbits disturbed by SRP and zonal gravity perturbations. Figure15 shows the stability modes of the three different types of frozen orbits depicted in Fig.11. The orbit transitions are presented in the a-e plane, and the stability modes are indicated by color. The shaded regions in Fig.15 represent infeasible cases defined by Eq.(38), where the spacecraft orbit can intersect the asteroid.Figure15a indicates that the northern terminator orbits can exhibit any of the four stability modes sketched in Fig.14. This distinctive feature was not observed in our previous study, which incorporates only the SRP and J2 perturbations [22]. It can be inferred from this finding that the joint effect of SRP and higher-order zonal gravities forms the complicated eigenstructure of frozen orbits. Figure15b shows that feasible (nonshaded) prograde ecliptic orbits are classified into region 1. This means that these orbits are linearly stable and thus might be feasible options for actual asteroid missions. The stability mode of the inclined elliptic orbits is displayed in Fig.15c, although this type of orbit is infeasible in the current system because of small periapsides. As shown in this figure, most of the inclined elliptic orbits correspond to either region 3 or region 4 and thus are unstable.Fig. 15 Stability modes of frozen orbits.The complex stability behaviors of the terminator orbits are analyzed in detail in subsequent paragraphs. Figure16a depicts the root locus expressed in the complex plane. Five eigenvalues calculated from Eq.(43) for each terminator orbit are plotted in this figure. The colors of the plots represent the semimajor axes of the orbits. On the other hand, Fig.16b shows the transitions of terminator orbits in the α-β plane. The α and β values are obtained from Eqs.(44a) and (44b). This figure indicates that the orbit family crosses the borders of the stability modes multiple times, at the points where bifurcations occur. Figures16a and 16b both demonstrate that the eigenstructure of the dynamic system investigated in this research exhibits complex profiles.The analytical analyses provided in this paper are further validated by numerical simulations. Figures17–19, respectively, depict the stability indices of the northern terminator orbits, prograde ecliptic orbits, and northern inclined elliptic orbits. In addition, some examples of numerically propagated orbits are included in Figs.17 and 18. The propagation results are expressed in orbit diagrams (Hill coordinate frame) and in the time histories of eccentricity, inclination, and the longitude of the ascending node. To avoid singularity for inclination, the longitude of periapsis, Π≡Ω+ω, is depicted instead of the longitude of the ascending node for the ecliptic orbits shown in Fig.18 [7,40]. The orbital motions are propagated based on Hill’s equation, given by Eq.(19), and the gravitational acceleration is computed based on model 2, defined in Table2. In the numerical simulations, the initial Ω and i values are perturbed by 3deg to compare orbital evolutions. The trajectories are propagated for 160days unless the calculation is terminated when a spacecraft trajectory intersects with a spherical asteroid with a radius of R¯. Note that the shaded areas in the a-e plane shown in Figs.17–19 correspond to the cases where Eq.(38) is satisfied. The primary parameters of the propagated frozen orbits are summarized in Table6.Fig. 16 Eigenstructure of northern terminator orbits.Figure17 indicates that the stability index profile of the northern terminator orbits is non-monotonous and that orbits with larger stability indices tend to involve stronger disturbances. For instance, the unstable orbit with ζ=1.2×10−6 depicted in Fig.17a diverges and eventually collides with the asteroid. In contrast, the stable orbit with ζ=0 illustrated in Fig.17b does not experience collision within 160days, even though the orbital size is similar to that of the orbit shown in Fig.17a. A comparison among Figs.17c–17e indicates that a frozen orbit exhibits weaker instability as the stability index decreases. The difference in the growth rates of perturbations is observed in the temporal variations of the orbital elements. One intriguing notion is that a stability index has a local maximum at a≃1  km, presumably because the coupling of SRP and gravity irregularity significantly perturbs the orbital motion in the intermediate-altitude region. The terminator orbits at large distances, such as the orbit shown in Fig.17e, are approximately identical to the conventional SRP-perturbed terminator orbit. Hence, the stability index converges to zero in accordance with the increase in the semimajor axis, as indicated by Eq.(49).Fig. 17 Analytical stability analysis and numerical simulations for northern terminator orbits.Fig. 18 Analytical stability analysis and numerical simulations for prograde ecliptic orbits.Fig. 19 Analytical stability analysis for northern inclined elliptic orbits.The prograde ecliptic frozen orbits depicted in Fig.18 all achieve long-term stability, as predicted by the analytical stability analyses provided in Fig.15b. Figures18a–18c show that these ecliptic orbits are bounded within some regions without collisions during the propagation period. However, the inclination history presented in Fig.18c exhibits slightly irregular behavior. This observation implies that when a periapsis is too close to the asteroid, gravitational perturbations can destabilize frozen orbits.From these observations, Figs.17 and 18 demonstrate that the numerical simulations agree with the analytical analyses, therefore validating the introduced dynamic theories on frozen orbits subject to zonal gravity and SRP perturbations. Although the dynamic asymmetries exist between the northern and southern terminator orbits and between the prograde and retrograde ecliptic orbits, they are expected to be minor given the similarity in the solution spaces depicted in Fig.10.Unlike the terminator and ecliptic frozen orbits, there is no feasible solution of the inclined elliptic orbits that can avoid an impact on the asteroid surface; nevertheless, the orbit stability can be analytically evaluated in the same manner. As depicted in Fig.19, the stability indices of the inclined orbits are larger than those of the other orbit families shown in Figs.17 and 18. This result implies that inclined elliptic orbits exhibit relatively strong instability presumably because of their large eccentricities; however, it does not rule out the possibility that this type of orbit can serve as a viable option in different systems.VI. High-Fidelity Numerical SimulationTo evaluate the feasibility of frozen orbits for actual asteroid missions, numerical simulations based on a high-fidelity gravity model are presented in this section. The terminator and ecliptic orbits shown in Table6 are propagated using Hill’s equation [Eq.(19)] and the polyhedral gravity model of Ryugu, which is defined as model 3in Table2. The direction of the spin axis exhibits seasonal variation due to the orbital motion of the asteroid, and its initial direction vector with respect to the Hill coordinate frame is set to be [0,−0.1454,−0.9894]T. Note that the orbit of the asteroid around the sun is assumed to be circular to simplify the comparison between the analytical theories and the numerical simulations. The numerical propagation is terminated when a spacecraft trajectory intersects with the polyhedral shape model of the asteroid.The numerical simulation results for the northern terminator orbits and prograde ecliptic orbits are illustrated in Figs.20 and 21, respectively. These figures depict the orbit diagrams and time histories of the orbital elements in the same manner as in Figs.17 and 18. The asteroid is rotating with respect to the Hill coordinate frame, and thus Figs.20 and 21 show the initial state of the asteroid. The initial state vectors of the spacecraft are the same as those provided in Figs.17 and 18.The orbit profiles depicted in Figs.20c–20e are similar to the corresponding diagrams provided in Fig.17. The growth rates of perturbations agree with those predicted in the analytical theories discussed in Sec.V. This result demonstrates the validity of the semi-analytical solutions of frozen orbits and their stability characterizations. As shown in Figs.20d and 20e, a spacecraft can naturally orbit around an asteroid for more than 150days even under SRP and gravity-field perturbations. On the other hand, the orbits illustrated in Figs.20a and 20b collide with the asteroid in 33 and 107days, respectively, although the latter orbit is linearly stable according to the result shown in Fig.17. This observation implies that when a spacecraft is located too close to an asteroid, the perpendicular-spin assumption, zonal-gravity approximation, and orbital-period averaging used to derive the frozen solutions lose validity, leading to significant variations in the orbital elements.Fig. 20 Numerical propagations of northern terminator orbits based on the polyhedral gravity model.Fig. 21 Numerical propagations of prograde ecliptic orbits based on the polyhedral gravity model.Among the three prograde ecliptic orbits illustrated in Fig.21, the left two orbits are bounded within certain spatial regions. The orbital elements of these two orbits exhibit simple harmonic oscillations, which agrees with the linear stability analysis. Although the variations in inclination are larger than those shown in Figs.18a and 18b, the orbital geometries remain approximately constant even in a polyhedral gravity field, demonstrating the feasibility of ecliptic frozen orbits. In contrast, the ecliptic orbit shown in Fig.21c, which has a smaller periapsis than the other two ecliptic orbits, gradually diverges and eventually collides with the asteroid in approximately 89days. It can be inferred from this finding that ecliptic orbits with a small periapsis can be destabilized due to predominant gravity-field perturbations, as is also observed for the terminator orbits presented in Fig.20.The high-fidelity numerical simulations described in this section imply that the frozen orbit solutions derived analytically based on the zonal gravity approximation are valid for Ryugu-like asteroids. It can therefore be concluded that the proposed frozen orbits are promising options for asteroid missions under gravity-field and SRP perturbations, particularly for target bodies with nearly perpendicular rotation axes and axisymmetric shapes.VII. ConclusionsThis paper investigated frozen orbits around asteroids under strong SRP and zonal gravity perturbations. First, perturbation models were introduced, and the accelerations due to the SRP, higher-order gravity, and solar tide were computed. This analysis clarified that the adopted Ryugu-based gravity model exhibits strong zonal acceleration corresponding to the J4 term as well as the J2 term. In the subsequent section, singly averaged LPEs that incorporate the SRP, J2, J3, and J4 perturbations were successfully derived. Based on this model, semi-analytical solutions for frozen orbits were obtained, in which the optimal eccentricity and inclination were visually identified using a two-dimensional variation map. The continuation of frozen orbits clarified that three types of frozen orbits exist, namely, terminator orbits, ecliptic orbits, and inclined elliptic orbits. The first two orbits are extensions of previously identified solutions. In contrast, inclined elliptic orbits are not feasible in the current system because of their large eccentricities. One of the major contributions of this research is its analytical characterization of the stability behavior of the derived frozen orbits. It was clarified that the frozen orbits exhibit four different stability modes depending on their characteristic eigenvalues, which was not observed in our previous study that focuses only on the SRP and J2 perturbations. Furthermore, a stability index was introduced to analytically quantify the orbital stability, demonstrating the existence of stable frozen orbits. The developed stability analysis scheme provides essential information for the design of frozen orbits in actual missions. In the last section, the obtained frozen orbits were propagated based on a polyhedral-gravity model to validate the aforementioned analytical theories. The high-fidelity numerical simulations showed that a spacecraft can naturally orbit an asteroid for more than 150days in relatively stable terminator and ecliptic orbits. From these observations, it can be concluded that the proposed frozen orbits serve as feasible options for asteroid missions and involve complex yet intriguing dynamic structures.Appendix: Derivatives of the Terms in the LPEsThe partial derivatives of the right-hand sides of Eq.(31) are derived here.
