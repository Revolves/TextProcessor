        "content": "35 mm grenade is a type of grenade launcher ammunition of Chinese origin. The type consists of many high-velocity and low-velocity grenades with a caliber of 35 mm (1.38 in). 35 mm grenades are proprietary designs originated from China. In 1980s, China began to experiment with different types of grenade launchers. Chinese designers felt Soviet 30 mm grenades had inadequate firepower, while NATO 40 mm grenades lacked portability, resulting in the adoption of 35 mm grenades for their grenade launchers, such as QLZ-87 and QLZ-04.[1]The 35 mm Type 87 is a series of high velocity grenades designed for Type 87 grenade launcher and other automatic grenade launchers. The grenades are stabilized with spin rifling. Type 87 has a typeical grenade design with the propellant stored in the base, the warhead in the middle part and the fuse in the nose section. The grenade is semi-rimmed with relatively short cases.[1][2]The shells can be stored in ammo box or attached to a belt. In additional to Type 87, the ammo can also be used by Type 04 automatic grenade launcher.[1][3] QLB-06, also known as QLZ-87B, is an improved version of the Type 87 grenade launcher shares the ammunition.[4] Various warhead types are available for 35x32 mm Type 87:[5]Type 87 cartridge Specification:QLU-11 utilizes a new version of the 35x32 mm (through old types are compatible).[6] New ammunition is specifically designed for long range accuracy. Type 11 long range cartridge derived from the DFJ-87 armor-piercing grenade, but the weight is reduced from 217g to 200g due to lighter casing. Propellant takes larger percentage of the cartridge space, thus improving the velocity from 195m/s to 320 m/s. This modification greatly increases the recoil, which QLU-11 features advanced primer ignition (API) blowback to mitigate.[7]35x115 mm Type 91 grenade is a series of low velocity grenades designed for Type 91 grenade launcher, which comes with shoulder-launched, rifle-attached, and vehicle-mounted variants. The cartridge has conventional design for breech loading similar to NATO 40 mm low velocity grenades.[8]Various warhead types are available for 35x115 mm Type 91, including but not limited to:[9]Type 10 is a series of low velocity grenades designed for QLG-10 and QLG-10A rifle-attached grenade launcher.

        "content": "Day Day Up (Chinese: 天天向上; pinyin: Tiāntiān xiàngshàng) is a popular Chinese talk show broadcast on Hunan Television. The show is co-hosted by Wang Han (汪涵), Da Zhangwei (大张伟), Qian Feng (钱枫), Wang Yibo (王一博). It has drawn great attention from the public, especially student groups and other young people for its humor, style, and the public figures who appear as guests.The Chinese title of the show 'tiāntiān xiàngshàng' (天天向上) was inspired from a Chinese idiom coined by Mao Zedong, 'study hard and make progress every day' (好好学习，天天向上; hǎohào xuéxí, tiāntiān xiàngshàng) which is literally translated as 'good study, day by day up'.[1]The talk show was created by the original team behind 'More Talk More Happiness' (越策越开心). The impetus behind the creation of Day Day Up was that with the 'decline of traditional virtues and etiquette' in China leading up to the 21st Century, the show would play an active role in conveying traditional Chinese values to viewers.[2] This would allow people to enjoy learning about Chinese traditions, especially of the arrival of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games around the time of the show's release. It employs both the young and the old for its humorous hosts in order to convey Chinese traditional values.[3]Prior to the release of the talk show, Hunan Television launched a series of marketing campaigns to increase the show's exposure. This was done through multiple 'prequel shows' (天天向上前传 or 'Day Day Up Prequels'). Starting from 8 August 2008, daily broadcasts of the show were shown to familiarise audience members with the format of the show and to raise interest towards the show's topics of discussion. In each of these episodes, there would be an opening show, six classes, and finally a talk from the 'Headmaster' (host of the show).[4]With the coronavirus outbreak, as it is advisable to stay indoors to reduce the risks of being exposed to the virus, the show got creative by conducting a new format called 'Cloud Filming'.[5]",
