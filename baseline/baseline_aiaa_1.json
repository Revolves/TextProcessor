A potentially universal and noninvasive approach is visual tracking. However, many tracking methods require manual selection of initial marker locations at the start of a tracking sequence. This study aims to address the gap by investigating a robust machine learning approach for unsupervised automatic labeling of visual markers. The method uses fast DBSCAN and adaptive image segmentation pipeline with hue-saturation-value color filter to extract and label the marker centers under the presence of marker failure. In a comparative study, the DBSCAN clustering performance is assessed against an alternative clustering method, the disjoint-set data structure. The segmentation-clustering pipeline with DBSCAN is capable of running real-time at 250 FPS on a single camera image sequence with a resolution of 1088×600 pixels.

        "date": 20201201,
        "content": "This paper proposes a three-dimensional, nonlinear guidance strategy for terminal-time-constrained interception of a nonmaneuvering target. The restrictive assumption of decoupling the three-dimensional interceptor–target engagement into two separate mutually orthogonal planes is relaxed. The guidance commands are derived using sliding mode control, with a time-to-go estimate that accounts for interceptor’s heading angle errors. It is shown that even for arbitrarily wide launch envelops, interception is guaranteed at a prespecified desired impact time. Further, a weighted control allocation technique is presented to allocate suitable lateral accelerations along the pitch and the yaw directions. Finally, numerical simulations, including extensive Monte Carlo assessments, are carried out with constant speed as well as two different realistic interceptor models that consider time-varying speed owing to aerodynamic parameter variations. Guidance strategy is shown to be effective in the presence of noisy measurements, uncertainties, and system lag. The performance of the proposed strategy is shown to be superior compared with an existing one."

        "content": "This paper addresses the problem of midcourse guidance of dual-pulse rocket motor interceptors with seeker field-of-view constraints using singular perturbation technique. The guidance law considers a combination of terminal velocity and flight time as a performance measure. In addition to the seeker field-of-view limit, constraints in the optimization problem include minimum dynamic pressure limit arising due to aerodynamic controllability. Using the time scale separation between the state variables, the full-order problem is reduced into lower-order subproblems, and a closed-form solution for guidance law is derived. It is shown that the performance of the interceptor is not very sensitive to perturbation of pulse firing time, and an offline generated lookup table is used to time the second thrust pulse firing. The proposed guidance law is computationally efficient, and its performance is benchmarked with that of pseudospectral-based feedback guidance with much lower computational cost. Simulation studies with point mass and six-degree-of-freedom model are presented highlighting the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed guidance law."

        "content": "In this paper, a cooperative guidance law is proposed for missiles with thrust control to realize impact angle constrained salvo attack, where missile speed limit is also considered. Guidance of a powered missile is decoupled into independent flight direction control with normal acceleration as an input to realize impact angle control/constrained guidance (IACG) and cooperative flight speed control with engine thrust as an input to realize salvo attack. Firstly, an IACG law is derived from a geometrically modified proportional navigation guidance. The trajectory shape and length under this proposed IACG law are proved to be independent of missile speed variation. Then a cooperative missile thrust control (CMTC) law is designed from a constrained consensus algorithm to cooperate remaining trajectory lengths without exceeding missile speed limit. Simplified aerodynamic and engine models of a missile are used in CMTC law design. The lower and upper bounds of speed are considered according to missile maneuverability and limited maximum engine thrust. Multimissile salvo attack with impact angle and time constraints is achieved through the combination of IACG and CMTC. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative guidance law."

The two-panel smart solar array based on shape-memory materials was designed and experimentally evaluated. The smart solar array consisted of two deployable solar panels, which were locked by one shape-memory alloy and two SMPC releasing mechanisms, and could be released by low shocking through electrical heating. The smart solar array was actuated and deployed using two groups of SMPC hinges. A series of tests was conducted to evaluate the main performance of the smart solar array. The tests included structural dynamics (folded state: sinusoidal sweep vibration, shocking, acceleration, and noise; and deployed state: mode, sinusoidal sweep vibration, and flexibility), thermal design, locking and releasing, and deployment. This smart solar array satisfied the design requirements, including the fundamental natural frequency in a folded state at 80 Hz, maximum the locking force at 2000 N.

Construction of a nonlinear modal-based reduced-order model of the aeroelastic system, employing a state-space realization of the linearized aerodynamics around an arbitrary reference point, allows us to capture the main nonlinear geometrical couplings at a very low computational cost. Embedding this model in both MHE and MPC strategies, which solve the system continuous-time adjoints efficiently to compute sensitivities, lays the foundations for real-time estimation and control of highly flexible aeroelastic systems. Finally, the performance and versatility of the framework operating in the nonlinear regime are demonstrated on two very flexible-wing models, with notably different dynamics, and on two different control setups: a gust-load alleviation problem on a very high-aspect-ratio wing with slower dynamics, which involves substantial deflections; and flutter suppression on a flexible wing with significantly faster dynamics, where an unconventional nonlinear stabilization mechanism is unveiled."

However, a camera cannot infer depth information on its own, which is often solved by introducing complementary sensors or a second camera. In this paper, an innovative model-based approach is demonstrated to estimate the six-dimensional pose of a target relative to the chaser spacecraft using solely a monocular setup. The observed facet of the target is tackled as a classification problem, where the three-dimensional shape is learned offline using Gaussian mixture modeling. The estimate is refined by minimizing two different robust loss functions based on local feature correspondences. The resulting pseudomeasurements are processed and fused with an extended Kalman filter. The entire optimization framework is designed to operate directly on the "

        "content": "This paper addresses the development and verification of an estimation architecture for autonomous relative navigation in multi-satellite systems using angles-only measurements. Unlike traditional angles-only navigation approaches, which are generally hindered by poor handling of observability constraints, this prototype solution is designed to be flexible and applicable to a multitude of relevant missions. The estimator converges accurately and robustly in varying orbital environments without requiring maneuvers by exploiting system nonlinearities using an unscented Kalman filter that is streamlined by formulating the measurement and dynamics models using relative orbital elements. While the majority of prior work has focused on only solving for the relative motion of a single target, the approach here enables estimation of several additional parameters. Key design trades are evaluated for estimating additive sensor biases, target ballistic properties in environments with strong nonconservative perturbations, adaptive process noise statistics, and the absolute orbit of the observing satellite. The architecture is generalized for relative navigation with multiple targets, and for decentralized estimation using multiple coordinated observers. These filter strategies are used to inform the development of a novel on-orbit demonstration of angles-only navigation known as the Starling Formation-flying Optical eXperiment (StarFOX) in partnership with NASA. Key hardware-in-the-loop algorithm verification results for StarFOX-specific scenarios are provided."

        "content": "This paper addresses the development and verification of an estimation architecture for autonomous relative navigation in multi-satellite systems using angles-only measurements. Unlike traditional angles-only navigation approaches, which are generally hindered by poor handling of observability constraints, this prototype solution is designed to be flexible and applicable to a multitude of relevant missions. The estimator converges accurately and robustly in varying orbital environments without requiring maneuvers by exploiting system nonlinearities using an unscented Kalman filter that is streamlined by formulating the measurement and dynamics models using relative orbital elements. While the majority of prior work has focused on only solving for the relative motion of a single target, the approach here enables estimation of several additional parameters. Key design trades are evaluated for estimating additive sensor biases, target ballistic properties in environments with strong nonconservative perturbations, adaptive process noise statistics, and the absolute orbit of the observing satellite. The architecture is generalized for relative navigation with multiple targets, and for decentralized estimation using multiple coordinated observers. These filter strategies are used to inform the development of a novel on-orbit demonstration of angles-only navigation known as the Starling Formation-flying Optical eXperiment (StarFOX) in partnership with NASA. Key hardware-in-the-loop algorithm verification results for StarFOX-specific scenarios are provided."

        "content": "This study presents the design and testing of a metallic thermal protection system (TPS) for future spaceplane vehicles. A conceptual design of the developed metallic TPS panel consisting of an outer sandwich structure, thermal insulation, inner support brackets, and a base framelike structure was redesigned from the metallic TPS panel developed by NASA. The thermal load was selected from a previous study, which was equivalent to the highest surface temperature of 1050 K. Nine metallic TPS prototype panels and supporting hardware structures made of 304 stainless steel were initially prepared for thermomechanical testing in room conditions. A noncontact thermal–mechanical measurement method was employed to measure full-field temperatures and deformations of the inner base structure and supporting hardware structures. The results indicated that the proposed design satisfied the requirements of temperature and permanent deformation limits. Panel-to-panel gaps showed a significant effect on the temperature rise in the inner base structure. The performance of the prototype proved the feasibility, reusability, and durability of using low-cost 304 stainless steel for TPS structures up to four thermal cycles, and may achieve more in further tests. Results provide valuable data for evaluating designs at the early stage of TPS development and testing in space conditions."
