 'content': '航空母舰，简称“航母”，是一种以舰载机为主要作战武器的大型水面舰艇，可以提供舰载机的起飞和降落。航空母舰舰体通常拥有巨大的甲板和舰岛，舰岛大多坐落于右舷。航空母舰一般总是一支航空母舰战斗群的核心舰船。舰队中的其它船只提供其保护和供给，而航母则提供空中掩护和远程打击能力。航空母舰大致可分为攻击型航空母舰和多用途航空母舰，二战结束后，随着科技的进步和作战思想的改变美国把航母的作战类型全部综合到一艘航母上即多用途航空母舰；按排水量大小可分为大型航母（排水量6万吨以上），中型航母（排水量3-6万吨）和小型航母（排水量3万吨以下）；按动力装置可分为核动力航空母舰和常规动力航空母舰。发展至今，航空母舰已是现代海军不可或缺的武器，也是海战最重要的舰艇之一。依靠航空母舰，一个国家可以在远离其国土的地方、在不依靠当地的机场的情况下施加军事压力和进行作战。航空母舰已是现代海军不可或缺的利器，也成为了一个国家综合国力的象征。航母初现第一次从停泊的船只上起飞世界上第一个驾驶飞机在军舰上起降的人是美国飞行员尤金·伊利（Eugene '
            'Ely）。1910年11月14日，尤金·伊利驾驶一架“寇蒂斯”双翼飞机从停泊在港口的“伯明翰号”巡洋舰（USS '
            'Birmingham '
            'CS-2）起飞，飞行了一段距离后安全降落在附近的一片海滩上。这是历史上人类第一次驾驶飞机从军舰上起飞。1911年1月18日，勇敢的伊利再次驾驶一架双翼飞机成功降落在处于停泊状态的“宾夕法尼亚号”（USS '
            'Pennsylvania '
            'ACR-4）上的一个长31公尺、宽10公尺的木制改装滑行台上。稍作休整后，他驾驶这架飞机从“宾夕法尼亚号”上起飞，完成了一次完整的起降试验。1912年5月2日，英国海军上尉格里高利驾驶着一架“肖特”S.27双翼飞机从以10.5节的航速行驶的“豪伊伯尼亚号”战列舰上起飞，从而创造了飞机从航行中的军舰上起飞的先例。发展历程在第一次世界大战前，水上飞机首先被用于海上侦察。各国海军都喜欢使用这种飞机，它能在水面上进行起飞和降落。但是水上飞机的装载和运输是一个大问题。早期的水上飞机只能被置于船后，由船只来牵引。一但遇上恶劣天气，缺少保护的水上飞机就有进水、发生倾覆的危险。1912年，英国海军把一艘老旧的巡洋舰改装成了世界上第一艘可容纳飞机的船只。后来，英国海军征用了3艘在英吉利海峡营运的渡轮，并把它们全部改装成可以装载水上飞机的军舰，这种船只后来被称为“水上飞机母舰”。它是航空母舰最早的雏形。暴怒号巡洋舰彻底改装后的最终形态在第一次世界大战的日德兰海战中，英国是唯一拥有舰载水上飞机的参战方。英国军方提出将水上飞机用于作战，并要搭配保护它的战斗机。因此不能再只使用没有飞行甲板、无法供空战能力更强的战斗机起飞的水上飞机母舰，必须重新设计另一种新军舰，这即是后来的航空母舰。1917年6月，英国皇家海军暴怒号巡洋舰在建造过程中改变原有设计，将舰艏部分上层建筑全部移除，转而铺设69.5米长的甲板供飞机起飞，这使“暴怒号”成为第一艘可以起降固定翼飞机的船只。不过起飞后的飞机无法返回母舰，只能去陆地的机场着陆。“暴怒号”1917年6月完工服役。1917年8月2日，英国海军少校、“暴怒号”海军航空兵指挥官欧内斯特·邓宁驾驶“幼犬”战斗机用与军舰平行飞行、侧滑着陆的方式降落到航行中的“暴怒号”前甲板上，地勤人员抓住了机翼后缘使飞机停了下来。这成为世界上首次飞机在航行中的军舰上降落的尝试。几天之后，邓宁再次试图尝试这个危险的降落方法时，飞机翻出军舰，坠入海中，邓宁以身殉职。1917年底至1918年初，英国对”暴怒号”进行了大改装，将后主炮和后桅拆除，在后部加装了86.6米长的飞行甲板。这样，以中部上层建筑为界，前部甲板用于飞机起飞，后部甲板用于飞机降落，飞机可以互不干扰地同时进行起降作业。尽管如此，”暴怒号”仍然不具有全通飞行甲板，飞机降落仍然十分困难。所以，此时的“暴怒号”还是一艘很不完善的航空母舰。第一艘安装全通飞行甲板的航空母舰是由一艘建造中的客轮“卡吉林号“改建的英国百眼巨人号航空母舰。它的改造于1918年9月完成。飞行甲板长168米，甲板下是机库，有多部升降机可将飞机升至甲板上。1918年7月19日，七架飞机从”百眼巨人号”航空母舰上起飞，攻击德国停泊在同德恩的飞艇基地。这是第一次从母舰上起飞进行的攻击。百眼巨人号1917年7月，英国开始建造世界上第一艘“纯正血统”的航空母舰，并将其命名为“竞技神号”（又译作“赫尔墨斯号”），以纪念航母的鼻祖——世界上第一艘水上飞机母舰“竞技神号”。信心满满的英国海军由于拥有了世界上第一艘航母，他们完全有理由认为：他们将建成世界上第一艘纯种航母。然而皇家海军忽视了一个正在日益崛起的对手，航空母舰发展史上的又一个“后起之秀”——日本海军。日本海军之所以具有较高的发展速度，其中一个重要原因在于善于向先进的海军强国学习，善于跟踪海军建设中的最新浪潮，一旦看准就不惜血本的大力建造。他们于1919年开始设计，1920年开始建造本国第一艘纯种航空母舰——“凤翔号”。在此之前英国海军订购的“竞技神号”航母于1918年1月开始动工，但由于第一次世界大战的结束，其工期进度明显放慢，直到1923年7月才最终建成。此时日本海军的“凤翔号”由于工期进展迅速，因而抢在1922年年底建成并开始正式服役。日本海军虽然后发但却先制，抢在英国海军之前建成了世界上第一艘纯种航母。美国第一艘航空母舰 '
            '兰利号美国第一艘航空母舰是1922年3月22日正式启用的兰利号（USS Langley '
            'CV-1）。“兰利号”并不是一开始就以航空母舰为用途所建造的舰艇，其前身是1913年下水的“木星号”运煤船（USS '
            'Jupite。1917年美国按照航空母舰标准全新设计建造了AC-3）。美国海军看上它运载煤炭用的腹舱容量充足因此将其改装为航空母舰。在改装中，“木星号”煤仓上甲板的上层建筑及起重机被全部拆除，从舰首至舰尾架设了13个单位桁架，在上面铺设了长165.3米、宽19.8米的全通飞行甲板。在甲板中心设置了一台飞机升降机。“兰利号”的机舱设置在军舰的尾部，原有的6个煤仓中的4个被改成飞机库，其余的被改成航空汽油库、弹药库和升降机械室。一战后，1922年各海军强国签署的《华盛顿海军条约》严格控制了战列舰建造，但条约准许各缔约国利用2艘战列舰改建为排水量3.3万吨的航空母舰。当时，作为东道主的美国正在建造6艘排水量为43200吨的“南达科他”级战列舰。而美国在太平洋战场上的潜在对手——日本海军对这一举动非常敏感。所以在条约签署时，日本的主要目的就是让美国放弃这6艘战列舰。经过反复讨价还价，美国被迫做出让步，暂停这几艘战列舰的建造。但作为交换条件，日本也必须放弃其在建的两艘排水量41000吨的“天城”级战列舰。此次谈判导致了两国第一代大型攻击航母的诞生——“赤城”级和“列克星敦”级。此时的英国由于受到美、日两国的影响也开始不甘寂寞，打算建造航空母舰。但英国在一战中大伤元气，所以最终选择了两艘大型巡洋舰“勇敢号”和“光荣号”作为被改装成航母的军舰。这时，美国的“列克星敦”级的2艘航母（CV-2“列克星敦号”和CV-3“萨拉托加号”）、日本的“赤城”级的“赤城号”、“加贺”级的“加贺号”两艘航母，以及英国的“勇敢号”、“光荣号”、“暴怒号”，并称为世界七大航母。1930年，英国建造的“皇家方舟号”航空母舰采用了全封闭机库、一体化的岛式上层建筑、强力飞行甲板、液压弹射器，被誉为“现代航母的原型”。1936年《华盛顿海军条约》期满失效，海军列强又展开了新一轮军备竞赛。美国的“约克城”级航空母舰、日本的“翔鹤”级航空母舰、英国的“光辉”级航空母舰是这一时期的杰作。二战时期二战时期航空母舰(6张)航空母舰在二战中首度被广泛运用。它是一座浮动的机场，携带战斗机以及轰炸机远离国土执行攻击敌人目标的任务。这使得航空母舰可以由空中来攻击陆地以及海上目标，尤其是那些远远超过一般射程之外的目标。航空母舰上的飞机的作战半径一直在改变海军的战斗理论，敌对双方必须在看不到对方的情况下，互相进行远距离的战斗。这彻底终结了战列舰为海上最强军舰的优势地位。航空母舰在战争中初建功勋是在1940年11月11日，英国海军的“光辉号”航空母舰出动鱼雷轰炸机编队攻击了塔兰托港内的意大利海军并且击沉一艘、击伤三艘战列舰。此举使美国等海上强国意识到航母时代的来临。二战中，航空母舰在太平洋战争战场上起了决定性作用。从日本海军航空母舰偷袭珍珠港，到双方舰队自始至终没有见面的珊瑚海海战，再到运用航空母舰编队进行海上决战的中途岛海战，从此航空母舰取代战列舰成为现代远洋舰队的主干。美国建造了大批“埃塞克斯”级航空母舰，组成庞大的航空母舰编队，成为海战的主角。当代航母二战结束后，世界各国都注重于发展适合本国的航空母舰，以维护本国海上利益。美国在战后对“埃塞克斯”级和“中途岛”级航空母舰进行了现代化改装，改装的项目包括增加斜角飞行甲板、蒸汽弹射器和助降设备，提高了舰载喷气式飞机的使用效率和安全性。高性能的喷气式飞机得以搭载到现代化的航空母舰上，并且航空母舰的排水量越来越大。福莱斯特级航空母舰是美国二战后第一级专为搭载喷气式飞机而建造的常规动力航空母舰。美国在使用这一级航空母舰时仍然发现了一些不足，于是在建造下一级航空母舰时对其进行大规模的改造和升级，这就是“小鹰”级航空母舰。它是世界上排水量最大的一级常规动力航空母舰，也是美国最后一级常规动力航空母舰。美国在建造“小鹰”级航母时，于1958年开工建造了企业号航空母舰（USS '
            'Enterprise '
            'CVN-65）。这是世界上第一艘核动力航空母舰。“企业号”于1961年服役，可以称之为“企业”级，但该级只建造了一艘。采用核动力的最大好处是提高续航能力，核动力燃料更换一次可连续航行数十万海里，使航空母舰具备了近乎无限的续航能力，消除了常规动力航空母舰大型烟囱对飞行作业的影响。在看到核动力的优势后，美国海军建造了一系列排水量10万吨的尼米兹级航空母舰。这是世界上威力最大、体积最大、排水量最大的航空母舰，其蓝本是根据小鹰级航空母舰改建的。[1]\xa0'
            '美国海军于2007年1月16日宣布，美国新一级核动力航空母舰正式命名为“杰拉尔德·R·福特号”（USS Gerald·R· '
            'Ford, '
            'CVN-78），以纪念在2006年12月26日晚间去世的美国前总统杰拉尔德·福特。“福特号”在2007年开始建造，于2017年7月22日交付，以取代服役时间超过50年的“企业号”（USS '
            'Enterprise CVN-65）。这也是美国进入21世纪建造的第一级航空母舰。[2]\xa0'
            '英国在战后发展了“无敌”级航空母舰，采用滑跃甲板和垂直/短距起降飞机。在1982年英、阿马尔维纳斯群岛（英称福克兰群岛）争端中，英国依靠它在远离本土8000英里的地方取得胜利。到2014年，“无敌”级航空母舰全部退役。2009年，英国新一级航空母舰“伊丽莎白女王”级航空母舰开工建造。该级共两艘航空母舰分别于2017年12月7日[3]\xa0'

            '现代航空母舰飞行甲板(6张)飞行甲板是航空母舰上供飞机起降和停放的上层甲板，按照任务需求可将其划分为起飞区、降落区和停放区。航母需采用比起船体宽度要大得多的飞行甲板。特别是斜直两段式甲板出现后，要进一步将起飞段板和着陆段区别开来，所以飞行甲板宽度更呈增加趋势。一般说来，大型航母的飞行甲板宽度几乎是舰体宽度的2倍，中小型航母的飞行甲板宽度约是舰体宽度的1.5倍。飞行甲板分为直通飞行甲板和斜角飞行甲板。[7]\xa0'
            '值得一提的是，现代航空母舰的飞行甲板通常为斜角飞行甲板，所以甲板比船体宽得多。从正面看去，飞行甲板向船体两舷张出，形状十分怪异。由于飞行甲板要承受飞机降落时的强烈冲击载荷，因此需用高强度金属制成。斜角飞行甲板斜角飞行甲板(5张)从航母出现直到50年代初，航母的飞行甲板都是直式的。其形状为矩形，防冲网把甲板分成前后两部分：前部供飞机起飞、停放用；后部则是飞机降落区。当防冲网放下时，前后两区合二为一，舰载机就能从舰尾向前做不用弹射器的自由测距滑跑起飞了。随着喷气式飞机的上舰，直式甲板的局限性就显露出来了。上世纪50年代初，英国海军上校卡梅尔提出了斜角甲板设想，经试验后证明它有许多优点，遂逐渐成为现代航母的标准甲板样式。航母甲板分为三部分：舰前部直甲板为起飞区，后半部斜角甲板为着舰区，斜直相交处形成三角形停机区。斜角甲板的斜度以斜角甲板中线与航母首尾中线的夹角来表示。斜角甲板的优点是着舰飞机未能钩住拦阻索时，可马上拉起复飞而不至于与前甲板停放的飞机相撞。另外，舰载机起飞和降落可同时进行。企业号的舰岛（改装后）现代航空母舰通常将上层建筑集中在飞行甲板的右侧，称为“舰岛”。从飞机起降的要求上讲，甲板上空无一物是最理想的，但航母的指挥塔、飞行控制室、航海室、雷达和通信天线等又需要高耸在甲板上。所以现代航空母舰都是将这些上层建筑设计得很紧凑，空出甲板的绝大部分来方便飞机起降。现代航母力求其外型简洁以减少雷达反射截面积，但其中技术非常复杂。已实现了上层建筑的“集结化”包括多功能相控阵雷达、封闭桅杆（AME/S）、电磁辐射系统（MERS）和多功能射频系统（AMRFS）。升降机升降机是将舰载机自机库运输至飞行甲板的装置。早期配置于全通飞行甲板的舰身中线的前中或后方，通常为2-3具。升降机也是甲板上最脆弱的部份，如果升降机故障或是遭到破坏会导致飞机无法起降，进而丧失战斗力。此外，炸弹也可能会击穿升降机，升降机又与堆积弹药与燃料的隔舱接近，一旦引爆将导致极其严重的后果。因此自“胡蜂号”航母起开始将升降机位置调整到舰侧，这除了不妨碍起降作业以及安全外，还有着飞机翼展超过升降机宽度时亦能使用的优点。值得一提的是，第一代超级航母的“福莱斯特”级曾在斜角甲板前方设置一个升降机，目的是要让飞机降落后立刻收入机库。然而后来发现这样的机会其实很少，另外航母航行时泼上来的浪会波及到舰载机。故自“小鹰”级起又将该处升降机位置调整至舰舷侧。现代大型航母的升降机宽20多米、深达15米、可负重100吨，升降速度约为一分钟自机库搬上一架飞机至甲板。   '
            '航空母舰的机库是容纳和检修舰载机的场所，高度通常占据2～3层甲板高度，是航空母舰上最大、最高的舱室空间。从航母发展历程来看，曾经出现过开放式机库和闭式机库两种。从航空母舰问世直到二战中期，航母上的机库都是开放式的，舰体上甲板就是机库甲板，也就是说把航空母舰的飞行甲板同时作为机库使用。它是一种真正开放的、没有任何隔壁的露天式机库。从二战中后期开始，航母闭式机库逐渐成为潮流。它是一种以飞行甲板为强力甲板，飞行甲板与强力纵梁牢固连接，纵隔壁从飞行甲板直延伸到舰体下都，把机库包在里面的一种机库结构。机库\u3000\u3000'
            '随着现代作战飞机的尺寸不断加大，为了能够存放全部飞机，航空母舰的机库必须足够的大。因此航空母舰上的机库一般长达 200～250米， '
            '宽25～33米，高6～9米，以满足舰载机的数量和大小、高度要求。大型航空母舰的机库相当于四五个大型剧院那么大。美军现役的“尼米兹”级核动力航空母舰，机库长208.48米，宽32.92米，高8.08米，能够容纳数十架作战飞机。[12]\xa0'
            '为了能多停放飞机，舰载机的机翼、机头和机尾最好都做成可折叠的，折叠好的飞机一架挨一架地整齐排列在机库内。为了保证机库的安全，用折叠式防火门将机库分隔成2 '
            '~ '
            '4个较短的机库。平时，折叠门收起，就是一个联通的大型机库，这样便于飞机的调动和保养维修。紧急情况下(比如发生火灾)，则可以迅速将折叠门放下，将一个大型机库分隔成几个小机库，这样可防止大火蔓延到整个机库，提高了机库的安全性。航母机库的用途不只是停放舰载机；航母机库通常情况下都不能装满，而是要留下空间用来维修保养舰载机以及飞行作业准备等重要工作场所，机库也是一个物资中转站。机库内的甲板上和飞行甲板一样，设置有停机位、锚链系留、牵引、升降机等配套设备。为了方便对舰载机的检查、维修保养还在机库内配备了电源、液压源、压缩空气源以及氮气源等等供给源和位置，母机库是一个修理所，负责维修保养舰载机以及其它的设备维修；机库除停放舰载机以外的最大功能非修理保养舰载机莫属，除非极度恶劣的天气，都要给维护保养舰载机腾出地方来，弹药库武器库是用来储备炸弹、鱼雷、导弹、火箭等武器的区域，位于船舰底部、水线之下，船头船尾各一处，中间则为机库。这些武器多以半组装方式收纳。为了将其送至甲板，武器库有着比飞机升降机更小的专用升降机（以“尼米兹”级为例，共有九个武器升降机，其外型如一个从甲板向上开启的门，若为不需用到的情况则可盖起来成为甲板的一部份），将武器从库中升到上一层甲板，由各层作业员进行阶段性的组装，再由该甲板的其他升降机往上送（部分通到机库），以防止弹药意外诱爆的情况。另外还有连接到舰岛右侧后方的一个武器集中区域，此处被称作“武器牧场”。若弹药爆炸可利用舰岛作遮掩，以降低对甲板上飞机的损害。第二次世界大战之后的美国航母还需要另外设计与区隔存放与组装核子武器的弹药库，被称为“特殊飞机维护储存区”（Special '
            'Aircraft Services '
            'Stores，简称“SASS”）。冷战时期基于核子武器的机密和敏感性，这些弹药库的使用、人员进出管制与保安都有特别的处理和操作程序，没有受到相关训练验证或者是无关的人员一概不得靠近。第一款安装SASS的航母是透过《27A改装案》来加装相关设备与空间的“埃塞克斯”级，在设计阶段就将SASS融入舰身结构的则是“福莱斯特”级航母。蒸汽弹射起飞一架F/A-18准备弹射起飞使用一个平的飞行甲板作为飞机跑道，起飞时一个蒸汽驱动的弹射装置带动飞机在两秒钟内达到起飞速度。只有美国具备生产这种蒸汽弹射器的成熟技术。在工作原理上，蒸汽弹射器使用高压蒸汽推动活塞带动弹射轨道上的滑块，把与之相连的舰载机弹射出去。它体积庞大，工作时要消耗大量蒸汽，淡水浪费严重，只有约6%的蒸汽被利用。为制造和输送蒸汽，航母要备有海水淡化装置、大型锅炉和无数的管线，工作维护量惊人。它的最大缺陷在于因为弹射力度太大而无法弹射无人机——现役的无人机因为重量过轻，在弹射时会被扯碎。蒸汽弹射有两种弹射方式：拖索弹射拖索弹射是50年代开始使用的老方式。顾名思义，就是用钢质拖索牵引飞机加速起飞。这种弹射方式比较少见，各方面都不如前轮牵引弹射好，只有法国的“克莱蒙梭”级航母使用。拖索弹射时，需要8-10名甲板人员先用钢质拖索把飞机挂在滑块上，再用一根索引释放杆把其尾部与弹射器后端固定住。弹射时，猛力前冲的滑块拉断索引释放杆上的定力拉断栓，牵着飞机沿轨道迅速加速，在轨道末端把飞机加速到直起飞速度抛离甲板，拖索从飞机上脱落，滑块返回弹射器起点准备下一次工作。[8]\xa0'
            '前轮牵引弹射前轮牵引弹射由美国海军在1964年试验成功。采用这种方式的舰载机的前轮支架装上拖曳杆，前轮就直接挂在了滑块上。弹射时由滑块直接拉着飞机前轮加速起飞，这样就不用8-10个甲板人员挂拖索和捡拖索了。这种方式的弹射时间更短，且飞机的方向安全性好。但这种舰载机的前轮需要专门设计。目前美国所有的航空母舰都采用了这种起飞方式。电磁弹射起飞电磁弹射器除此以外，电磁弹射是新一代航母的舰载机起飞方式。与传统的蒸汽弹射器相比，电磁弹射器具有容积小、对舰上辅助系统要求低、效率高、重量轻、运行和维护费用低廉等优点。电磁弹射采用电磁的能量来推动被弹射的物体向外运动。与蒸汽弹射器相比，电磁弹射器的优点主要是体积减小了很多，操纵人数也要少30%左右，而且电磁弹射器的弹射力度可控可以弹射无人机。缺点是耗电，但对于全电力推动的航母和核动力航母来说并不是太大的问题。美国海军从1982年开始进行电磁弹射系统的技术研究，直到2004年秋天电磁弹射器进入成品测试阶段。美国海军测试后选定通用原子能公司作为生产商美国海军技术网站透露，通用原子能公司的系统采用线性电磁加速电动机已经在新泽西州赫斯特湖试验中心完成了测试。目前美国的电磁弹射技术已经运用于“福特”级航空母舰上。[9]\xa0'
            '电磁弹射器是一个复杂的集成系统，其核心是直线弹射电动机。这种电动机的概念类似磁悬浮列车采用的技术。与磁悬浮列车所不同的是，磁悬浮列车的运动是漂浮在空气中，而弹射电动机带有滚轮，带着一个往复车沿弹射器轨道滑行。工作时，电动机得到供电往复车在电磁力的作用下拉着飞机沿弹射冲程加速到起飞速度飞机脱挂后，往复车受到反向力的制动，低速回到出发的位置。滑跃起飞有些航空母舰在其甲板前端有一个“跳台”帮助飞机起飞，即把甲板的前头部分做成斜坡上翘。舰载机经过滑跑后沿着上翘的斜坡冲出甲板，形成斜抛运动，在刚脱离母舰的一段（几十米）距离内继续在空中加速以达到起飞速度。这种起飞方式不需要复杂的弹射装置，但是飞机起飞时的重量不如弹射起飞，使得舰载机的载油量、载弹量、航程以及作战半径等受到一定的制约。英国、意大利、印度、中国和俄罗斯等国由于技术限制，暂时无法研制真正在技术和工艺上过关的弹射器，所以只能在本国航母上采用滑跃甲板。采用滑跃起飞的航空母舰在舰载机起飞时都必须以20节（36公里/小时）以上速度逆风航行，以加大舰载机相对速度帮助其起飞。垂直起降技术顾名思义就是飞机不需要滑跑就可以起飞和着陆的技术。这是从20世纪50年代末期开始发展的一项航空技术。F35B联合攻击战斗机使用垂直起降技术的飞机机动灵活，具有常规飞机无可比拟的优点。首先，具有垂直起降能力的飞机不需要专门的机场和跑道，降低了使用成本。其次，垂直起降飞机只需要很小的平地就可以起飞和着陆，所以在战争中飞机可以分散配置，便于伪装，不易被敌方发现，大大提高了飞机的战场生存率。最后，由于垂直起降飞机即使在被毁坏的机场跑道上或者是前线的简易机场上也可以升空作战，所以出勤率也大幅提高，并且对敌方的打击具有很高的突然性。但使用垂直起降技术的飞机也有许多缺点。首先是航程短。由于要实现垂直起降，飞机的起飞重量只能是发动机推力的83%-85%，这就使飞机的有效载荷大大受到限制，影响了飞机的载油量和航程。同时，飞机垂直起飞时发动机处在工作的最大状态，耗油量极大，因此限制了飞机的作战半径。例如当“鹞”式飞机的载重量为1060千克时，作战半径只有92公里。所以在实际使用中“鹞”式飞机尽量使用短距起飞的方式以延长飞机的航程。因此垂直起降飞机又称为垂直/短距起降飞机。另外由于垂直起降飞机在实战中经常需要分散在野外，所以它的维护也非常的困难。但随着航空科技的发展，垂直起降技术必将进入一个新的发展高峰。[10]\xa0'
            '拦阻网着舰减速降落方式采用拦阻索装置和拦阻网装置。拦阻索装置在正常情况下是舰载机缩短着舰滑跑距离的主要降落装置；而拦阻网是在舰载机处于危急情况下着舰时使用的一种应急设备，一般情况下是用不到的，拦阻降落是主要的降落方式，美国现役11艘大型航母、包括法国戴高乐号，以及俄罗斯库兹涅佐夫号和中国辽宁号以及山东号等航空母舰上的舰载机均采用此类降落方式。拦阻索位于大型航母斜角甲板的中心线，一般情况下在距甲板尾端55-60米处起设置第一根拦阻索，然后每隔约14米即设置1根，一连设置4根（但按现在美国航母的发展趋势，将逐渐减为3根）。每根钢索直径大约为3.5厘米，钢索离甲板的高度为35-50厘米，由弓形弹簧张起，且其两端通过滑轮与甲板下方的液压阻尼缓冲器相连。拦阻降落固定翼舰载机降落前，在空中先放下起落架和襟翼，以实现减速与降低高度的目的。与此同时，还将舰载机尾钩放下。舰载机着舰后，仍以约200千米/小时的速度向前冲刺，通过伸出的尾钩，可钩住甲板上弓起的4根拦阻索中任何一根。钩住拦阻索的舰载机带着巨大的能量继续向前滑跑；拦阻索两端连着的液压阻尼缓冲器带动了主活塞支柱，将制动液由液压作动筒挤压进蓄压器，使蓄压器内的空气被急剧压缩，从而产生阻尼力。拦阻索被拉得越长，蓄压器内的空气压力就越大，产生的阻尼力也将越大，从而使舰载机的速度迅速降低。一般情况下，舰载机滑跑60-90米后，就能完全停在甲板上。美国海军现役的MK-7型着舰减速装置，可将时速达195千米的重22.7吨的舰载机在92米内阻拦停住。舰载机在航母上着落，需要服从航母的航空管制程序。按照固定的航线进入下滑坡道。 '
            '小鹰号航空管制系统这里首先要提到的航母降落的设施就是航空管制系统了。这个系统的核心主要是航空管制雷达和航空管制控制台。以小鹰号为例：我们可以注意到在桅杆右侧有一个方形的抛物面雷达，这个雷达叫做AN/SPN-43 '
            '空中交通管制雷达。在250英里以内飞行的舰载机都会被这个雷达监控和标记，同时管制控制员会对所有在这个雷达上所看到的舰载机进行统一调度。但小鹰号上的AN/SPN-43雷达是一个很老的雷达系统，只能给航空管制员发送模拟信号，航空管制员需要靠经验去对舰载机进行调度。 '
            '而在2007年开始，美国海军开始在航母上换装更先进的航空管制雷达系统。并且航空管制信息已经实现了飞机上的数据链系统连接，因此航空管制员的工作强度降低,[11]\xa0'
            '菲涅耳光学助降系统为了确保舰载机着舰安全，美国海军还配有“菲涅耳”透镜光学着舰系统。它能使驾驶员更好地知道它相对于正确的下滑航道的位置信息，便于安全降落。此外，还配有增益目视舰载机回收系统，该系统是装在着舰系统两侧的两排灯阵，它对夜间着舰的安全性具有很大的作刚，能指示进场飞机的沉降率，进场飞机的精确位置由其跟踪探测系统给出。垂直绿色灯阵有两排，以向驾驶员显示其沉降率太低、太高或最佳。如果舰载机因尾钩放不下来，或尾钩损伤，或舰载机受损，或燃油不多而又无法复飞等原因时，就需迫降。此时，需要临时架设拦阻网，以迫使舰载机减速停止下来。由于飞机上载有大量的航空汽油，发生火灾也是常有的事。而且一旦发生事故，后果极其可怕，往往机毁人亡。舰载机降落流程(拦阻降落)弹射器对维护使用的要求很高。要彻底解决安全降落问题，最好是垂直降落。所以，超短距起飞，垂直降落，已经成了当前航母舰载机在起降方面发展的基本趋势。“海鹞”等垂直/短距起降飞机不需要拦阻索和拦阻网等助降设施，即可直接降落在飞行甲板上。通常“海鹞”战斗机垂直降落时所需的甲板面积直径约为20米。此时，航母不需要掉转船头或做其他机动动作，以保证“海鹞”战斗机迎风着舰。推进系统常规动力航母的动力系统，其实就是相当于把一个中型燃油热电厂的设备搬到一艘大船上。因此，常规动力航母的动力包与热电厂的设备有很大的相似之处，区别主要是蒸汽能源的来源：常规动力航母一般是用燃油锅炉烧柴油或重油。英国的“伊丽莎白女王”级航母的动力是燃气轮机和柴油机联合，有总功率不足的隐患。航母动力包启动前需要进行设备“吹管”，即用高温高压蒸汽，将主蒸汽管道内的杂质和焊渣吹干净，以免伤害汽轮机转子叶片。“辽宁舰”服役初期，前后水线部位侧面冒出黑烟和蒸汽，同时发出很大的噪音，就是在进行首次动力启动前的吹管。 '
            '西屋A4W核反应堆核动力航母，由于能源来源是核反应堆，几乎可以提供无尽的蒸汽。在船不运动的时候，绝大部分蒸汽用来发电。美国尼米兹级核动力航母使用两具功率各130000马力的西屋A-4W反应堆最大发电功率超过5万千瓦，相当可观。一艘十万吨级超级航母的本身用电量，就相当于一个中小城市。美国福特级核动力航母，电能成了全船动力的核心。其蒸汽轮机大部分动力都用来发电，总发电功率高达10万千瓦级别。预计福特级后期批次的航母，将直接用巨型电动机推动推进螺旋桨。巨型电动机的能源由发电机通过电缆输送，因此整条船，连四根动力大轴都取消了，并且舰载机的弹射和拦阻，都是全电化。这就是最先进的全电舰艇。美国尼米兹级核动力航空母舰是依靠西屋公司的两个核反应堆产生高压蒸汽提供动力和电源。所提供的电力会在舰上长达100千米的主电路内输送。早期航母搭载的舰载机与传统战斗机基本相同。不过为了满足可以在有限空间内收纳、从飞行甲板上起降等要求，专门为舰载设计的飞机产生了。由于在被赋予艰难任务的同时，还要能在海风侵袭的恶劣环境下操作，所以舰载机的寿命通常不会太长。舰载机飞行员必须要具备极高的飞行技巧，毕竟在飞行甲板上起降比在平坦的陆地上起降要困难很多。航空母舰编队(36张)舰载机的种类主要是按照其任务类型来区分。首先，战斗机是用来担负舰队防空与攻击护卫警戒任务的，有时还具有反潜、对地攻击能力。在第二次世界大战时期，还开发出为了击沉敌舰的特殊机种。俯冲轰炸机就是最好的代表，它是一种可以从敌人头顶进行攻击的机种。鱼雷攻击机是可以搭载鱼雷或炸弹的机种，在大战末期整合成攻击机，现在则是采用精密制导炸弹或导弹进行攻击。用以进行搜索的侦察机是不可或缺的，过去曾研发出专用的机体，在现在则有在战斗机上挂载侦察夹舱做成的战略侦察机，以及搭载强大雷达的早期预警机。伴随着攻击机队，可对敌方雷达进行干扰，是一种相当可靠的支援机种。另外，由于战后的潜艇在性能方面有所提升，出现了反潜机，有时这个任务也会交给直升机来担任。至于其他方面，由于垂直/短距起降战斗机只需要用很短的跑道，对于没有长飞行甲板的轻型航母或两栖攻击舰而言，常被当作战斗机使用。舰载机的种类与代表机型舰载机种类主要任务代表机型战斗机空对空战斗美国F-14轰炸机以炸弹对船舰与地面目标进行攻击日本99式舰爆鱼雷机以鱼雷、炸弹进行对舰或对地攻击日本97式舰攻攻击机整合轰炸机与鱼雷机的机种美国A-19战斗攻击机整合战斗机与攻击机的机种美国F/A-18电子战飞机以电子战进行支援美国EA-6侦察机侦查日本二式舰侦预警机依靠雷达搜索敌人美国E-2反潜机搜索、攻击敌潜艇美国S-3运输机运输物资美国C-2航空母舰飞行甲板上的地勤人员通常按照司职分为七类，其中每个人都被指定着有色运动衫（或显眼的外套）。被指派负责某类单独作业的人员佩戴不同颜色的头盔、或穿着特殊记号或者在运动衫及外套上有指定标记的衣服加以区分。蓝：在航母上工作最简单的就是那些穿蓝装的舰员了。踏上航母，你会发现，身着蓝色工作服、头戴白色头盔的升降机操作员随时待命。他们会根据指示将舰载机从机库升至舰面。如果遭受意外攻击，他们会立即将飞机封藏在机库里。飞机轮挡员穿蓝服、戴蓝盔。他们负责抽除和垫上轮挡。穿蓝服、戴蓝盔且工作服上印有“T”字符号的为传令兵，而穿蓝服、戴蓝盔、工作服胸背印有牵引机符号的则是舰上的牵引机司机。黄：飞机准备升空时，航空母舰便转向宜于飞机起飞的航向上。这时引导飞机向前移动的是身穿黄色工作服的飞机起飞指示人员。他们的任务是将飞机准确地放置在蒸汽弹射器上。绿：身穿标有“C”字绿色工作服的弹射器操纵员通过前起落架牵引系统和夹紧装置，将飞机的前起落架与弹射器的往复车紧密相连。准备就绪后，飞行员即按照穿黄色工作服、戴黄帽的指示人员给定的信号，松开刹车、加大功率。随后穿黄服、戴绿帽的飞机弹射官以手势发出起飞信号。白：美国航空母舰上穿白色服装的人数比较多。飞机降落指挥官身着标“LSO”的白色工作服，不戴头盔。他指挥的位置位于左舰后部的一个平台。他需要详细了解降落飞机的特性、气象情况、飞行员情况，并随时与飞行员联系，及时准确操纵灯光信号，确保飞机安全着舰。航母上采用阻拦索以保证飞机减速降落。它能使舰载机在100米内停住。这项工作由身穿绿衣、戴绿头盔的阻拦索操作员承担。中队飞机检查员穿白服、头戴绿盔，工作服上涂有黑白交叉排列图案及中队符号。白服上标有“LOX”符号、戴白头盔的为液氧员。标有“SAFETY”符号的是安全员。医务人员则是白衣白盔且胸背均标有红十字。红：穿红色服装的舰员通常承担极具危险性的工作。如飞机失事救护员、爆炸物处理员、消防员和飞机军械员，都身穿红色工作服、戴红头盔。褐：直升机器材检查员穿褐色工作服、戴红帽，外场机械员则为褐服绿帽。紫：航空燃料员一般是紫服紫帽，工作服上还印有“F”标志。（注：带有*的是双舰岛）国家名称舷号满载排水量/吨级别起飞方式动力服役时间现役航母美国尼米兹号航空母舰CVN-68100,000尼米兹级蒸汽弹射核动力1975-05-03艾森豪威尔号航空母舰CVN-69101,6001977-10-18卡尔·文森号航空母舰CVN-70101,3001982-03-13罗斯福号航空母舰CVN-71104,6001986-10-25林肯号航空母舰CVN-72104,1121989-11-11华盛顿号航空母舰CVN-73104,2001992-07-04斯坦尼斯号航空母舰CVN-74103,3001995-12-09杜鲁门号航空母舰CVN-75103,9001998-07-25里根号航空母舰CVN-76101,4002003-07-12布什号航空母舰CVN-77102,0002009-01-10福特号航空母舰CVN-78112,000福特级电磁弹射2017-07-22中国辽宁号航空母舰1660,900库兹涅佐夫级001型滑跃常规动力2012-09-25山东号航空母舰1763,000002型2019-12-17英国伊丽莎白女王号航空母舰*CVA-0165,000伊丽莎白女王级短距常规动力2017-12-07威尔士亲王号航空母舰*CVA-0265,0002019-12-10意大利加富尔号航空母舰55027,100加富尔级短距常规动力2008-03-27加里波底号航空母舰55113,850加里波底级1985-09-30印度维克拉玛蒂亚号航空母舰R3345,000基辅级滑跃常规动力2013-11-16俄罗斯库兹涅佐夫号航空母舰06361,390库兹涅佐夫级滑跃常规动力1991-01-21法国戴高乐号航空母舰R9142,500戴高乐级蒸汽弹射核动力2001-05-18泰国差克里·纳吕贝特号航空母舰R-91111,400阿斯图里亚斯级短距常规动力1997-08-10（现役，已停用）在建已下水航母土耳其阿纳多卢号航空母舰未知约28,000未知滑跃常规动力预计2020年后美国肯尼迪号航空母舰CVN-79120,000福特级电磁弹射核动力预计2020年后印度维克兰特号航空母舰R4440,000维克兰特级滑跃常规动力预计2025年后在建未下水航母中国未知未知90,000003型电磁弹射核动力未知美国企业号航空母舰CVN-80132,000福特级电磁弹射核动力未知规划中航母中国未知未知未知004型电磁弹射核动力未知美国米勒号航空母舰CVN-81未知福特级电磁弹射核动力未知印度维沙尔号航空母舰R5565,000维沙尔级电磁弹射常规动力未知韩国未知未知未知未知未知未知未知',

The type consists of many high-velocity and low-velocity grenades with a caliber of 35\xa0mm (1.38\xa0in). 35\xa0mm grenades are proprietary designs originated from China. In 1980s, China began to experiment with different types of grenade launchers. Chinese designers felt Soviet 30\xa0mm grenades had inadequate firepower, while NATO 40\xa0mm grenades lacked portability, resulting in the adoption of 35\xa0mm grenades for their grenade launchers, such as QLZ-87 and QLZ-04.[1]The 35\xa0mm Type 87 is a series of high velocity grenades designed for Type 87 grenade launcher and other automatic grenade launchers. The grenades are stabilized with spin rifling. Type 87 has a typeical grenade design with the propellant stored in the base, the warhead in the middle part and the fuse in the nose section. The grenade is semi-rimmed with relatively short cases.[1][2]The shells can be stored in ammo box or attached to a belt. In additional to Type 87, the ammo can also be used by Type 04 automatic grenade launcher.[1][3] QLB-06, also known as QLZ-87B, is an improved version of the Type 87 grenade launcher shares the ammunition.[4] Various warhead types are available for 35x32\xa0mm Type 87:[5]Type 87 cartridge Specification:QLU-11 utilizes a new version of the 35x32\xa0mm (through old types are compatible).[6] New ammunition is specifically designed for long range accuracy. Type 11 long range cartridge derived from the DFJ-87 armor-piercing grenade, but the weight is reduced from 217g to 200g due to lighter casing. Propellant takes larger percentage of the cartridge space, thus improving the velocity from 195m/s to 320 m/s. This modification greatly increases the recoil, which QLU-11 features advanced primer ignition (API) blowback to mitigate.[7]35x115\xa0mm Type 91 grenade is a series of low velocity grenades designed for Type 91 grenade launcher, which comes with shoulder-launched, rifle-attached, and vehicle-mounted variants.

The show is co-hosted by Wang Han (汪涵), Da Zhangwei (大张伟), Qian Feng (钱枫), Wang Yibo (王一博). It has drawn great attention from the public, especially student groups and other young people for its humor, style, and the public figures who appear as guests.The Chinese title of the show 'tiāntiān xiàngshàng' (天天向上) was inspired from a Chinese idiom coined by Mao Zedong, 'study hard and make progress every day' (好好学习，天天向上; hǎohào xuéxí, tiāntiān xiàngshàng) which is literally translated as 'good study, day by day up'.[1]The talk show was created by the original team behind 'More Talk More Happiness' (越策越开心). The impetus behind the creation of Day Day Up was that with the 'decline of traditional virtues and etiquette' in China leading up to the 21st Century, the show would play an active role in conveying traditional Chinese values to viewers.[2] This would allow people to enjoy learning about Chinese traditions, especially of the arrival of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games around the time of the show's release. It employs both the young and the old for its humorous hosts in order to convey Chinese traditional values.[3]Prior to the release of the talk show, Hunan Television launched a series of marketing campaigns to increase the show's exposure. This was done through multiple 'prequel shows' (天天向上前传 or 'Day Day Up Prequels'). Starting from 8 August 2008, daily broadcasts of the show were shown to familiarise audience members with the format of the show and to raise interest towards the show's topics of discussion. In each of these episodes, there would be an opening show, six classes, and finally a talk from the 'Headmaster' (host of the show).[4]With the coronavirus outbreak, as it is advisable to stay indoors to reduce the risks of being exposed to the virus, the show got creative by conducting a new format called 'Cloud Filming'.[5]", 'attributes': None}

{'keyword': '航空母舰', 'source': 'wiki', 'title': 'Fang Chih', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fang_Chih', 'date': 202109201317, 'content': "Fang Chih or Fang Zhi (Chinese: 方治; 23 November 1895 – 28 March 1989), courtesy name: Xikong (希孔), was a politician, provincial governor, diplomat, author and a high-ranking Kuomintang official of the Republic of China.Fang Chih was born into the prominent Tongcheng Fang clan in Tongcheng, Anhui, Qing empire in November 1895.[citation needed] His father was Fang Rong (Chinese: 方蓉; pinyin: Fāng Róng, courtesy: 方镜卿), the middle son of Fang Lanfen, a Qing dynasty author.[citation needed] He is a direct descendant of Fang Zhipu (方至朴) and Fang Zhenru (方震孺), an early Qing scholar, author, magistrate and Governor of Guangxi Province. He was also a descendant of Fang Bao, a distinguished Qing author[9] who founded the Tongcheng school of literary prose.[10]His paternal uncles were Fang Quan, a late Qing dynasty era prefect and Fang Zao (Chinese: 方藻; pinyin: Fāng Zǎo, courtesy: 方澄卿). Fang's father died when he was 1 or 2 years old in 1896 and his mother sent him to be raised by his paternal uncle Fang Quan and paternal grandfather.[11]Fang Chih graduated from Anhui Province Tongcheng Secondary School (Chinese: 安徽省桐城中学), known as a producer of many revolutionary Anhui leaders, which he attended alongside Zhang Bojun, Wu Zipei (Chinese: 吴子培), and Yu Guanglang among other notable classmates. Due to the hostility between the Beiyang government regime and the KMT, many of the KMT families moved into exile in Japan and Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition defeated Beiyang by 1928. In 1919, with financial support from his uncle, Fang Peiqing (zh: 方培卿), Fang Chi went to Tokyo, Japan where he learned Japanese and pursued his studies at the Tokyo Higher Normal School and the Tokyo Imperial University. On 14 July 1925, Fang married Masue Ueki (Fang I-chih, Chinese: 方益之; pinyin: Fāng Yìzhī), a Japanese woman,[1][12] fellow Kuomintang member and classmate at the Tokyo Imperial University studying dentistry. He would graduate with a master's degree from the College of Arts and Science at Tokyo Imperial University in 1927.[citation needed]Whilst at school, Fang was involved in the leadership structure of the KMT student groups active in Japan in the Chinese student community. These groups were founded by the Tongmenghui clique cemented in Japan by Wang Jingwei.[13] The KMT student organization was set up in the Kanda district where a Chinese communist group was already active at the Tokyo YMCA. Specifically, Fang was involved in countering Communist propaganda and student groups run by Japanese educated Chinese Communists such as Shi Qian (zh: 史迁), Wang Buwen, Tong Changrong (zh: 童长荣), Yu Dahua (zh: 余大化) and Fang Bin (zh: 房斌) at the Hubei Railway School of Tokyo or the Tokyo Railway Specialized School, a school set up by Zhang Zhidong for Chinese international students whose graduates went on to serve in the railway industry at Hubei for 6 years.[14]Fang Chih returned from Japan in 1927. After his return, he joined the Northern Expedition of Chiang Kai-shek working in Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan and Hubei Provinces where he gained the attention of General Chiang. He was made the Chairman of the Fukien Provincial Party Headquarters of the KMT at the suggestion of a fellow Japanese educated classmate Dai Chuanxian with Chiang's approval. This role was expanded to oversee the KMT Chairmanship of Anhwei Provincial Party Headquarters and that of Tsingtao. Whilst in Anhwei, Fang Chi led a political purge of the local party together with Shao Hua on the orders of Chen Lifu, founder of the CC Clique or the Central Club Clique and head of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the Central Committee.[15] The purge mechanism in Anhwei later swept up his former rival and classmate from Japan, Wang Buwen who was arrested in April 1931 and executed the following month. His work during this period was focused primarily in Hupeh, Kiangsi, Qingdao, Nanking, Hunan, Anhwei and Fukien provinces in various military, political, party affairs and education related jobs.His organizational skills and writing ability soon gained the attention of Chen Lifu, with whom he regularly corresponded. The connection with Chen Lifu aligned Fang with the CC Clique faction of the KMT and led to his increased involvement in the operations of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics. By March 1929, he was promoted to Chief Secretary of the Department of Propaganda of the Central Committee by Shao Yuanchong who was one of four people responsible for the lyrics of the National Anthem of the Republic of China. He was posted to Nanking and Shanghai. In 1930, he was acting Minister of Information and by September 1931, he was promoted to the Chief Secretary of the Publicity Committee.[16]In the early 1930s, rumors in Shanghai began spreading of an assassination list compiled by a secretive KMT group that became collectively known as the Blue Shirts Society. By 1933, these rumors began to come into the mainstream Shanghai press, particularly due to articles printed in the left leaning China Forum published by American radical Harold Isaacs. On 20 July 1933, due to the perceived negative public perception, Fang published an article in the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury denouncing the rumors and the existence of the Blue Shirts saying 'No Blue Shirts; No (death) list, its all wrong.'[17][18]In fact, the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, the CC Clique's counterintelligence organ was heavily involved in myriad kill or capture missions in Shanghai during this period. In 1929, Zhou Enlai returned to Shanghai, after a brief period of exile following the 1927 Shanghai Massacre, to set up the Communist response to the KMT called the 'Special Service Section of the Central Committee' or 'Teke' (zh: 中央特科). This led to a bloodbath culminating in the summer of 1931 with a full blown purge and the second flight of Zhou Enlai from the city.In April 1931, KMT agents arrested Gu Shunzhang in Wuhan. Gu was one of Zhou's Aides of Security Affairs and his interrogation and subsequent defection from the Communists yielded to the Nationalists the entire scope of Zhou's operations in Shanghai and beyond.[19] On 21 June 1931, Gu's entire section of the Special Service was either captured or fled with 24 arrested including his superior and General Secretary Xiang Zhongfa in Shanghai and Cai Hesen in Hong Kong. Xiang was quickly executed after his interrogation and the resulting windfall of information led the KMT to conduct an even greater purge of the Communist intelligence networks. The scope of this purge was put at around 3,000 Communists by the  French Intelligence Bureau of the Shanghai French Concession and lasted until at least 1934 as the Communists from Jianxi attempted to reestablish networks in Guangzhou and Shanghai under Chen Geng and Deng Zhongxia.  Deng and Chen were both arrested though only Deng was executed as Chen had saved Chiang Kai-shek's life during a previous battle against the Warlord Chen Jiongming.[20]Gu Shunzhang was executed in Suzhou in December 1934 or June 1935.By 1935, the counterintelligence situation had quieted down with most of the Communist networks significantly weakened. Fang was an elected to become a member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee,[21] attending the Kuomintang 5th National Congress in November[22] where he was confirmed as Deputy Minister of Propaganda. He was also transferred again, this time to Tsingtao Municipality and served as the KMT Chairman of the region.As Deputy Minister of Propaganda in the period leading up to war with Japan between 1931 and 1937, Fang began to focus his activities on exploiting what he perceived to be a growing division between a majority of the Japanese population being largely desirous of peace and a minority of pro-militant actors supporting an invasion of China policy embedded in high places within the Japanese government since the tenure of Tanaka Giichi as Prime Minister[23][24] and headed contemporarily by Prime Minister Hideki Tojo.[25] In around 1935, Fang organized a daily radio broadcast in Japanese operating from two pseudo official Japanese stations located in Fukuoka and Nagasaki respectively. The messages conveyed were on the mutual destruction that war would bring to both nations, the shared history and culture between Japan and the ROC.[26]The broadcasts ceased after a serious diplomatic incident between Japan and the ROC ensued following a party at the Japanese Consulate General in Nanking where Deputy Foreign Minister and Foreign Affairs Secretary and Wang Jingwei loyalist Tang Youren (Chinese: 唐有壬) let slip that the radio program was being run under Fang's supervision. Once the information reached Tokyo, the Japanese government issued the ROC an ultimatum to either extradite both Fang and his wife to Japan or a Japanese battleship would be dispatched from Shanghai to Nanking to raid the KMT Headquarters. In response, KMT Secretary General Yeh Chucang (Chinese: 葉楚傖) requested that Fang terminate the program. The matter was deferred to Chiang Kai-shek who decided to stop the broadcasts but moved to protect Fang. He also asserted that any incursions into the Nanking area by Japanese naval forces would be met with force. On 1 November 1935, Wang Jingwei stepped down from his post when he was shot at by a sniper in an assassination attempt just before the 5th National Congress.[27] Tang Youren was relieved of his duties as Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister in early December 1935 and transferred to become Vice Minister at the Ministry of Transport and Communications. He was assassinated in Shanghai on 25 December 1935 before assuming his new role.[26][28][29][30][31][32]Fang attended the Second National Motion-Picture Conference which was convened by the Central Party Publicity Committee in Shanghai. Fang used the motion picture industry in Shanghai to promote KMT party ideals to the people. These propagated the ideas of the New Life Movement which was the brainchild of General Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling and was supported by the CC Clique and the Blue Shirts Society.[33]In October 1935, Fang collaborated with Zhang Daofan, Lei Chen, and Yu Shangyuan to build the Nanjing National Theatre Academy where Yu was installed as president. The school was run as an organ of the KMT Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Education. In 1938, a second school was opened in Sichuan, Jiang'an County and named the National Theatre Academy. It was the first modern drama school for higher education ever built in China.In November 1935 at a meeting of the KMT Big Five, Fang Chih was elected to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang cementing his position as a prominent fixture of the administration. In July 1936, there was a shakeup of the propaganda department after Liu Luyin was arrested on spy charges by Dai Li who was carrying out a purge of the party and Fang became the vice minister of the Board of Publicity.[21]On 13 August 1937, Fang was transferred to the Ministry of Education, a department run by Minister and KMT Party Chairman Wang Shijie. The following year, Chen Lifu was appointed as Minister of Education.In October 1938, with the CC Clique's hold on the Ministry of Education in place, Fang Chih was appointed to the position of Education Commissioner of his native Anhwei Province (Anhui Province) and of Hupeh Province (Hubei Province).On 19 May 1938, a squadron of two Chinese Air Force Martin B-10 bombers took off from Ningbo. The squadron flew over Nagasaki, Fukuoka, Kurume, Kyushu, Saga, and Sasebo distributing over 1 million leaflets containing various propaganda and disinformation, completing the mission with no human losses.[34]In the late 1800s, Fang's uncle Fang Quan, who was a late-Qing era prefect and Tongcheng School literary figure, returned to Tongcheng to oversee the establishment of the Huabiao Primary School (zh: 华表小学), serving for a time as its principal. Fang oversaw the completion of Anhui Number 4 Provincial Primary School  (zh: 安徽省省立第四临时小学会宫分校) in 1939.In early 1941, Fang Chih was named the Party Chief and Chairman of the KMT in Chungking. He was again elected to the Central Executive Committee at the 6th National Congress of Kuomintang in May 1945. In January 1946, Fang Chih was involved in an effort to disrupt Communist rally activities in Chungking celebrating the legalization of the CCP the previous year. The rallies which were held throughout January and early February, were hosted by high level Communist representatives like Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Ma Yinchu, Li Dequan who acted as general chairman and Li Gongpu who acted as the organizational commander. Chen Lifu tasked Fang, Ye Xiufeng and Wang Sicheng (zh: 王思诚) with organizing the violent suppression of the rallies. Fang's agents spied heavily on the rallies in efforts to document the Communist opposition forces who were operating in the open following the Double Tenth Agreement. Fang also collaborated with Chen Lifu, Ye Xiufeng and Wang Sicheng to move against the Communists by mobilizing large scale anti-Soviet marches around Chungking.[citation needed] From 16–19 January, Guo Moruo, Zhang Dongsun and other Communists were attacked. On 26 January, police raided the home of Huang Yanpei, a Democratic League agitator and CCP ally.This series of confrontations boiled over on 10 February with the Jiaochangkou Incident which has been recorded as one of the major triggers leading to escalation in the Chinese Civil War.[35] The incident has been covered in many historical accounts, including most recently, the 2009 propaganda film The Founding of a Republic.[36] The Communists were meeting to celebrate the People's Consultative Conference and the concentration of radical Communist elements attracted the KMT secret police who violently dispersed the crowd though no actual fatalities were recorded though around 60 were wounded, some seriously. Both the KMT and the Communists used the incident to push for military escalation. Mao Zedong pushed for the CCP to withdraw entirely from the unity government and to pursue a military campaign following the incident, which he argued could be taken to mean that Chiang Kai-shek was not committed to peace.[37]People tend to forget this (Chiang's commitment to anti-Communism), especially when the situation quiets down a little. We forgot this in 1–9 February; but, we remembered this again after the Jiaochangkuo Incident... All that has happened lately proves that Jiang's[note 1] anti-Soviet, anti-CCP, and anti-democratic nature will not changeThe KMT also used the incident to justify further crack downs on an increasingly active and anti-KMT CCP. Li Gongpu was assassinated by KMT agents on 11 July 1946 in Kunming. Li's funeral was also targeted on 15 July resulting in the assassination of Wen Yiduo.[38]In October 1946, Fang Chih was made the party boss and chairman of the Shanghai KMT Municipal Government, replacing Wu Shao-hsu, one of his longtime rivals within the CC Clique.[39] He was also made General Secretary of the Beijing-Hangzhou Government Garrison Headquarters Standing Committee. With the cessation of all the foreign concession areas by 1946, the city, was entirely under Nationalist control.[40] During his tenure, Fang Chih collaborated with Du Yuesheng of the Green Gang to consolidate various agitation groups and to root out Communist activity.[41]By May 1946, Fang was dealing with increasingly serious political tension between Communist and Government student groups. These tensions boiled over in June when the opposing groups staged demonstrations with the pro-government groups rallying on 21 June and the Communists on 23 June.[42]Between 1946 and 1949 during Fang's tenure in office, the population of Shanghai swelled from around 3.7 million in 1946[43] to 7.73 million in 1949[44] with Shanghai accounting for around 50 percent of all the factories in China, more than half of all Chinese shipping trade[45] and roughly 33 percent of China's total GDP.[46]In 1947, Fang was elected to the political council of the Kuomintang.[47] In September 1947, the Nationalist government attempted a ban on commercial dance halls as an austerity measure to be implemented due to the ongoing civil war.[48] In response to the unpopular decision, which was implemented slowly and reluctantly by the Shanghai government, 200,000 taxi dancers took to the streets and riots ensued.[49] Fang's propaganda machine attempted to ease the situation with statements saying that dancing girls should be redirecting their talents to reconstructing the country and eliminating the Communist bandits. A Time magazine article quoted Fang attempts in this regards: I think no patriotic man or woman wants to embrace each other under soft lights... Dancing girls could be trained to acquire useful talents in reconstructing the country and wiping out bandits....[50]Fang also made attempts to turn the selected dance halls that were actually closed into cafeterias employing the former taxi dancers.[51] In the end, the halfhearted ban served to drastically increase prostitution in the city, an issue that remained even after the government completely abandoned any further attempts to shutter the dance halls. Towards 1949, as a successful Nationalist defense of Shanghai became less likely, the problem became a useful way to lash out at the city's future management. By the time the Communists took over the city in 1949, there were around 40,000 licensed and unlicensed prostitutes operating in the city. The prostitution problem was a large obstacle for the Communists and remained an issue for them until around 1953 when prostitutes were sent en masse to labor camps.[52]In August 1948, Fang delivered a speech to a large scale anti-Communist rally in Shanghai together with mayor K.C. Wu and Chairman of the City Council, Pan Kung-chan.[53]In early 1949, the tide of the war was beginning to turn decidedly in favor of the Communists following the developments in the Huaihai and Pingjin Campaigns. The Nationalist army had lost around 1.5 million soldiers between 1948 and 1949.[54] On 6 January 1949, Fang made a proposal to send a delegation of Shanghai's citizens to speak with Communist officials, following a convening of Kuomintang policy makers which resulted in an agreement to attempt to sue for peace.[55] The move was seen as a response to the disobeying of Chiang Kai-shek's orders to march to the front and give battle by three Nationalist generals; Pai Chung-hsi, commander of the Hankow Garrison holding the Yangtze River West of Nanking, Chang Chen, provincial commander of Hunan's Provincial Army whose troops were the only military force between the capital and the Communists to the north, and Chang Chien, commander of Changsha south of Hankow. The three commanders had attempted to force Chiang's resignation by sending telegrams asking Chiang to take a 'vacation' instead of giving battle to the Communists.[55][56]Fang's action, which was made to stall for time, did little to hinder the opening of a new front in Anhwei by the Communists on 5 January, but it presented the quite accurate image of an increasingly desperate situation faced by the Nationalists. The situation was used as the background for Washington lobbyist William C. Bullitt who petitioned the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs for a military intervention.[55][57][58]Around this time, Chiang realized that the relocation or retreat of the entire army to Taiwan to regroup for a counterattack was not the ideal strategic move. Noting the sizeable amount of former Japanese soldiers demobilized from the Japanese surrender still present in China under Nationalist control, Chiang also tasked Fang and a group of Kuomintang members with Japanese backgrounds, including Cao Shicheng, to look into the creation of a joint Sino-Japanese military force to hold the fledgling Eastern Coast of China against the Communists. A letter was delivered by Cao to former commander of the Japanese Imperial Army in China and the Japanese Chief of the KMT's Central Liaison Office to Deal With Remaining Soldiers since December 1945, Yasuji Okamura, informing him of the dire situation facing the Nationalist army and requesting that he order deactivated elements of the Japanese Imperial Army into Chiang's service as part of a Sino-Japanese army group.[59][60] Okamura was actually convicted of war crimes in November 1948 at the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal and then immediately protected by Chiang who took the general as an advisor. The Republic of China found Okamura not guilty in 1949 and returned him to Japan. In any event, these actions were too late to make any difference in the campaign.By April 1949, the Nationalist army was in full retreat and the Communist forces were advancing on Shanghai.[61] Earlier in the year, Fang had been made Secretary General of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison General Headquarters and was tasked outwardly with coordinating the retreat and relocation of personnel to Hong Kong and Taiwan.[2][62]The Nationalist government did not allow most of the local population of the city to flee until the last possible moment for propaganda and psychological reasons resulting in a chaotic and disorganized retreat and a failure to effectively evacuate the city's wealth resulting not only in a devastating loss of people, property and financial assets. The excessive troop commitment to Shanghai's defense, which was a strategically unimportant city and only of political value, would go on to seriously hinder the fledgling Nationalist war effort. The KMT blunder at Shanghai, resulted in the further bleeding thin of its forces, and facilitated an easier campaign for the Communist victories at Ningbo, Wenzhou and Canton Province.At 11:00 am on 24 May 1949, Fang gathered the foreign press at the Broadway Mansions where he announced the Nationalist plans to hold the city:[63][64][65]In order to deal the fatal blow to the Communist bandits, the Government made a decision to defend Shanghai to the last. General Tang En-po, with the highest determination, the groundwork completed, with... strong defense works, huge manpower, endless reserves of wealth, and the highest morale yet seen, has determined to defend the land and the people... Shanghai’s defenders will hold out to the end... Every building in Shanghai is flying a Nationalist flag... the city will be defended street by street if necessary, even if it means the destruction of Shanghai... the Reds have lost 60,000 dead and wounded; 4,500 prisoners and 500 machine guns in besieging Shanghai. The Reds have suffered five casualties for every one sustained by the Nationalists... Being thoroughly trained and well-balanced correspondents, I would not doubt your duty to report this to the world... Shanghai will be defended like Stalingrad.On 25 May 1949, Fang Chi was forced to flee the city with the retreating Nationalist army together with Lei Chen, Ku Chen-kang, Chou Tse-jou and probably Tang Enbo, the last officials out of the city.[66] Shanghai fell to the CCP two days later on 27 May with approximately three fourths of the KMT defense forces killed or captured. Ironically, Fang's media statements threatening house to house fighting similar to the Battle of Stalingrad turned out to be disinformation as almost none of the fighting in the Battle of Shanghai took place inside the city. Some 153,000 Nationalist casualties were recorded which included the complete loss of the KMT 37th Army, the KMT 51st Army and 5 Traffic Police Divisions. Most of the survivors retreated to Taiwan via Guangzhou. In May, Fang was installed as Secretary-General, KMT Chairman and Acting Governor of Fukien Province at Foochow.By Mid-August 1949, the strategic situation for the Nationalists in Fukien was increasingly focused on having the retreat be as organized as possible. Focus had shifted entirely from engaging the Communists militarily to rearguard actions and the defense of Kinmen and Xiamen islands. On 15 August, this strategy was made public by the Kuomintang's Central Planning board who tasked Fang, Tang Enbo, and Lei Chen in the organization of the defense of the two Fukien islands.[67]Mainland Fukien fell to the Communists in around November 1949 but many of its outlying islands including Quemoy (Kinmen) were successfully defended and the Republic of China retains control of them to this day. The defense of Kinmen specifically was extremely successful. The plan, allegedly formulated with the assistance of former Imperial Japanese Army planners,[68] consisted of allowing PLA forces to land on the island en masse, to cut off their retreat and supplies by gaining control of the sea and then to wipe out the remaining ground forces.Pacification of the Mainland province by the Communist victors was not completed until February 1951. As a result of the fall of Mainland Fukien, the CCP set up Fujian Province with its capital at Fuzhou. The KMT, who retreated mainly to Taiwan, retained the province as Fukien Province and moved its capital from Foochow to Jingchen. The Battle of Guningtou proved to be the decisive battle that halted the Communist advance on many of the coastal islands still under KMT control, however many of these islands were later abandoned by the KMT or taken by force by the Communists during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis.Later in 1949, Fang Chih was made Secretary-General of the newly founded Free China Relief Association, an organization that outwardly aimed to assist Chinese diaspora refugees displaced by the war and those still on the Mainland through relief aid. The organization was chaired by Ku Cheng-kang and its directors included Soong Mei-ling, Chen Cheng and Hu Shih amongst others.[69] In around 1954, the organization came under the umbrella of the Asian People's Anti-Communist League (APACL), a group founded jointly by Chiang Kai-shek of the ROC, Syngman Rhee of the ROK, and Elpidio Quirino of the Philippines. Ku Cheng-kang, Fang's partner at the FCRA would go on to head the APACL in Taipei and the two would continue this collaboration for the rest of their lives.[70][71]In 1954, Fang Chih was involved in relief and publicity activities during the islands campaign in the final stages of the Chinese Civil War.[72]During the Korean War, Fang made several trips to the Korean peninsula where the KMT military was heavily involved in ground operations. Fang was in charge of an operation which saw the repatriation of Chinese 'Volunteer' P.O.W.s to Taiwan as opposed to returning them to Mainland China. After the ceasefire which ended main phase of the Korean War , U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who negotiated the ceasefire himself, placed a provision in the agreement that Chinese prisoners of war would be allowed to choose where they would be repatriated. Contemporary Communist news sources attribute this decision to Fang Chih's 'deception'.[73] Of around 21,000 PVA prisoners,  about 14,300 or two thirds of these prisoners held by the allies were sent to Taiwan[74] after the war due to the voluntary repatriation program.[75][76] The day of the prisoners return to Taiwan is now recognized as World Freedom Day in Taiwan and South Korea. The experiences of Chinese POWs during the Korean War have been fictionalized in Jin Xuefei's 2004 book War Trash.Fang's role in the solicitation of mainland defectors or Anti-Communist Martyrs as they were known in Taiwan, expanded greatly during the Korean War and he later ran a program that rewarded mainland Chinese pilots with gold and other incentives if they defected to Taiwan with their warplanes.[77][78]Following the defeat of the KMT in the Chinese Civil War, most of the Nationalist forces had retreated to Taiwan, however a significant portion of the Western army, which became known collectively as the Kuomintang 93rd Division, retreated from Yunnan Province into Burma and Thailand. Forces of the 15,000 strong KMT 13th Army under Li Mi established himself in Burma,[79] nearly creating a Shan State and attempted to invade Yunnan Province no less than seven times.[80] The 3,000 strong KMT 3rd Army under General Ly Wen-huan established themselves in Tang Ngop, Chiang Mai Province and the 4,000 strong KMT 5th Army under General Tuan Shi-wen established themselves in Mae Salong, Chiang Rai Province.[81][82] From around 1949, Fang became heavily involved in anti-communist activities in Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Burma and throughout Southeast Asia.In late July and early August 1959, Fang was involved in FCRA operations in Laos, officially to help a group of around 8,000 displaced Chinese who had entered Laos as a result of political persecution in the mainland. On 4 August 1959, Fang reported that the group was drastically in need of supplies and had come from Yunnan Province.[83] On 27 August 1959, Fang Chi attended the foundation of the Sino-Laotian Friendship Society of which he was a trustee together with Ku Cheng-kang. The  organization collaborated with the FCRA in an official capacity to bring relief aid to Chinese refugees in the Golden Triangle. The society also participated to an uncertain extent in operations with the Sananikone family's Veha Akhat and with the CAT though FCRA cooperation with the latter likely continued throughout the period.[84]In January 1961, the Burmese military, in a secret alliance with the People's Liberation Army mounted a combined military operation against a major KMT base near the Mekong River. 5,000 Burmese troops and three divisions of the PLA attacked the fortified KMT base which was defended by an army of around 10,000 men. The operation was successful and the Burmese managed to defeat the KMT on 26 January though they retreated in good order. On 16[85] February 1961, a PB4Y-2 Privateer[85] or a B-24 Liberator[86] operating with the FCRA and carrying a payload of weaponry for the irregular troops who were retreating across the Mekong river into Laos and Thailand, was shot down by the Burmese Air Force resulting in a complaint being lodged at the United Nations. The aerial incident also involved the shooting down of a Burmese plane and the damaging of another suggesting that the mission could have been escorted by fighters. Fang accepted responsibility for the mission on behalf of the FCRA stating the private association's actions were completely separate from those of the Republic of China.[86]The area of operations of the Free China Relief Association was not restricted solely to the Golden Triangle. The organization was deeply embedded in pursuing the various overseas interests of the ROC throughout Asia and in the west.Fang was involved in refugee relief actions via the FCRA[87] and the Chinese National Committee for World Refugee Year of which he was Secretary-General. Fang represented the Republic of China together with Li Ten-ping, the Assistant Secretary-General of the International Labor Bureau, before the UNHCR in Geneva, Switzerland.[88] From 12 to 26 January 1960, the council met in Geneva, Switzerland where the executive committee, chaired by Dr. Elfan Rees discussed the year's agenda. At the conference, Fang outlined his objectives to deliver aid to refugees from Tibet together with John McCarthy, Director of the Department of Immigration at the National Catholic Welfare Council.[89] Fang also outlined goals of assisting Chinese refugees in Hong Kong.[90] In May 1960, his committee was responsible for raising around US$10 million for Chinese refugees in Hong Kong where the FCRA had established an office since 1950[91][92] working closely with the Rennie's Mill Camp Refugees Relief Committee.[93] Some of the money was funneled to KMT organizations in the area of Tiu Keng Leng or Rennie's Mill, known for some time as Little Taiwan, which was a major support base for the Taiwanese cause until 1996 when the Hong Kong Government cleared the land for redevelopment with an eye on the upcoming transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong.[91][94][95]Attempts to evacuate ex soldiers living in the Rennie's Mill area of Hong Kong by the FCRA largely slowed or stopped in around 1980 when the duties of care and refugee relief in British Hong Kong were transferred from the Free China Relief Association to the Red Cross Society of China, after which no figures on evacuations to Taiwan were published.[96]Following the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, the ROC mobilized the FCRA to organize disaster relief operations in the areas of Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan. The FCRA collaborated with the Bank of Taiwan to provide a large quantity of donated humanitarian aid and food items from the people of Taiwan and organized bulk shipments via the International Red Cross to be distributed in the mainland. Beijing refused the aid shipments and the FCRA decided to launch the aid parcels directly to the mainland using unmanned balloons in collaboration with the Ministry of National Defense. These actions apparently triggered the scrambling of MiG interceptors tasked with shooting down the balloons. ROC Ambassador to the U.S. James Shen confirmed ROC actions to provide mainland disaster relief:...We would agree to have our help channeled through some international organization... We want to help the people. We have no quarrel with the people. They are our people. Our quarrel is with the Communist officials... (Peiping was handling the relief) in a typical Communist way, not in a typical Chinese way... They are more afraid of foreigners getting in than of their own people dying after an earthquakeTaiwan's furious response to the mainland's refusal to accept the aid was a powerful piece of political drama at the time, serving its interests at home and abroad.[97]In 1958, Fang Chih founded and became the president of the Sino-Ryukyuan Cultural and Economic Association, an organization dedicated to maintaining cultural and economic dialogue between the people of Taiwan and Ryukyu-Okinawa.[98]Following the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II, the island of Okinawa was administered directly by the U.S. occupation forces from 1950 until May 1972 when the island was turned over to the Japanese government. The severance of official diplomatic relations between Japan and the Republic of China in September 1972 forced the association to effectively become the de facto embassy of the Republic of China in Okinawa. Fang's position at the Association demonstrated the importance the Republic of China placed on Okinawa / Ryukyu which hosted the largest U.S. military presence in the region. The military buildup on the island during the Cold War saw a dramatic increase in the strategic importance of the islands. Under the 1952 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, the USFJ have maintained this large military presence.A contemporary US Civil Administration report from 1965 described Fang as follows:[99]...Actually he is one of the greatest brains of the Republic of China, serving as a national policy advisor to the President of the Republic of China and also as chief secretary for the Association for Relief of Compatriots in the Chinese Mainland (FCRA). The fact that he is concurrently serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China-Ryukyu Cultural and Economic Relations Association shows the importance being attached by the Republic of China...The office continues in its function under the same name[100][101] despite politically motivated attempts in 2006[102] to rename the office under the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office system.In October 1985, Fang Chih convened the first Taipei-Naha Symposium which occurs annually alternating between Tokyo and Naha. The meetings were inaugurated after Professor Katsutaro Shimajiri (jp: 島尻勝太郎) of Okinawa University visited Taiwan in October 1983 for the purpose of a cultural exchange.[103]Following the retreat to Taiwan, Fang was consistently involved in anti-Mainland propaganda until the time of his death.From March 29 to April 9, 1969, Fang attended the Kuomintang's 10th National Congress in Taipei.In 1984, Fang wrote a column for Hong Kong magazine Cheng Ming where he attacked Mainland Chinese media censorship.[104]In 1988, Fang was appointed the Vice-President of the Free China Relief Association. Fang served together with Ku Cheng-kang who acted as president and C.C. Chen who served as its Secretary General.[105]Fang Chih married Masue Ueki (Fang I-chih, Chinese: 方益之; pinyin: Fāng Yìzhī), a Japanese woman,[1][12] fellow Kuomintang member and classmate at the Tokyo Imperial University studying dentistry on 14 July 1925. The couple, both of whom grew up in only child households, had 11 children, three boys and eight girls.By Masue Ueki:Three of his children, Fang Guanglong, Fang Guanghu and Fang Guangfu became notable Taiwanese scientists. Fang Chih is also the maternal grandfather of American Fashion designer Anna Sui, a descendant of his first wife, Masue Ueki via the couple's first daughter, Fang Guangqi and her husband Paul Sui.[107]Fang Chih died of natural causes on 28 March 1989 in Taipei, Taiwan Province, Republic of China at the age of 94.A memorial and mausoleum[108] was built in his honor on Okinawa island complete with a statue bust and information on his accomplishments in Okinawa where he is remembered for his efforts to develop the post-World War II  economy and for his influence in opening the island to trade with the Republic of China given the two islands' shared history of Japanese and Chinese influences. The phrases 'Friend of the Ryukyuan people', 'I love China' and 'I love Ryukyu' are engraved on the right and left sides of the statue respectively as a tribute to his connection with the people of the island and the people of Japan despite the turbulent political atmosphere of his times.The tomb is located on Onna Hill facing the East China Sea on the outskirts of Onna Village in the Kunigami District near Naha, Okinawa Prefecture.[107]", 'attributes': {'name': 'Fang Chih', 'img': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/FangChiOkinawaMemorial1.jpg_FangChiOkinawaMemorial5.JPG/220px-FangChiOkinawaMemorial1.jpg_FangChiOkinawaMemorial5.JPG', 'img_des': 'The memorial to Fang Chih at Okinawa.', 'President': 'Chiang Kai-shek', 'Governor': 'Sa Chen-PingYang Shu-chuang', 'Succeeded by': 'Chen Tiao-yuan', 'Preceded by': 'Wu Shao-hsu', 'Born': '(1895-11-23)23 November 1895Tongcheng, Zongyang County, Anhwei Province, Qing Empire', 'Died': '28 March 1989(1989-03-28) (aged 93)Taipei, Taiwan Province, Republic of China', 'Resting place': 'Onna Village, Kunigami District, Okinawa Prefecture, Kyushu, JapanCoordinates: .mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output .geo-dec{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault,.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct{display:none}.mw-parser-output .longitude,.mw-parser-output .latitude{white-space:nowrap}26°26′47″N 127°48′19″E\ufeff / \ufeff26.44639°N 127.80528°E\ufeff / 26.44639; 127.80528', 'Citizenship': 'Republic of China', 'Nationality': 'Chinese', 'Political party': 'Kuomintang', 'Alma mater': 'Tokyo Higher Normal SchoolTokyo Imperial University', 'Allegiance': 'Republic of China', 'Branch/service': 'National Revolutionary Army', 'Rank': 'Secretary GeneralChief Executive', 'Unit': 'Beijing-Hangzhou Garrison Corps, General Headquarters Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Corps, General Headquarters', 'Battles/wars': 'World War IIChinese Civil War: Fall of Shanghai, GuningtouKorean WarBurma Campaign'}}

The aircraft physical appearance similar to Yak-130 and Aermacchi M-346. The aircraft made its maiden flight on 13 March 2006. The aircraft's general designer is Mr. Zhang Hong (张弘), and development had reportedly been completed alongside Yakovlev OKB of Russia.[4] The JL-10 is a direct rival to the Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation (GAIC) JL-9/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle in competition for the People's Liberation Army Air Force's (PLAAF) next-generation advanced trainer aircraft program.[citation needed]HAIG unveiled a full-scale mock-up of its early prototype the L-15 advanced lead-in fighter trainer (LIFT) in the 2004 Zhuhai Airshow. The two-seat, two-engine L-15 featured the latest advanced technologies developed by China, such as the digital quadruple fly-by-wire (FBW), glass cockpit (two multi-color head down displays for both the front and rear cockpit, and an additional head-up display for the front cockpit) and hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) flight control. The look-down field of view for the front cockpit is 18°, and 6° for the rear cockpit, exceeding the US requirement.  The aerodynamic performance of the aircraft is enhanced by its large leading edge extensions (LEX) design, which gives a maximum angle of attack of 30°. This is very useful when trying to simulate the maneuvers of advanced fourth-generation fighters such as J-10, JF-17 and J-11, as well as for newest fifth generation fighter like J-20 and J-31. JL-9/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle trainer jet from Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation (GAIC) is a direct competitor of the JL-10. JL-10 has a wide range of more advanced features comparing JL-9, but JL-9 is significant cheaper and its development and production would be fully indigenous, while early batches of JL-10 still rely on AI-222 series turbofan engine from Ukraine before an indigenous update is ready.[5]With the JL-10, student pilots will be able to complete mission flight training and advanced combat training, as well as complete all basic jet flight training courses. The aircraft also has six (four under-wing and two wingtip) pylons to carry various air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons. If necessary, it can serve in the lightweight attack role with minor modifications, carrying up to 3.5 tons of armament.[6]Each of the first two units (#01 & #02) are powered by two Ivchenko-Progress DV-2 engines, which do not have afterburners, and these two aircraft thus do not have the capability to reach supersonic speed. The third unit (#03) is powered by a pair of an improved version of the DV-2, the DV-2F, that has afterburners, so that it can attain supersonic speed.  The subsequent production units are expected to be powered by Ukraine's Ivchenko-Progress AI-222K-25F turbofan engines with afterburners once a co-production license is obtained by the 608 Institute. Ivchenko-Progress was able to increase the thrust of the AI-222-28F (thrust 4500\xa0kg afterburning) and AI-222-30F (5000\xa0kg thrust afterburning) engines. The latter two engines may be used to equip the JL-10 or other Chinese aircraft.[7] Meanwhile, according to various Chinese reports, JL-10s with updated Guizhou FWS-17 engines had already undergone test flights.[6]In June 2013, the AJT condition of L-15 finalized the design and would be operated by PLAAF with a formal name JL-10.[8] On July 1, 2013, the first batch of JL-10 began delivery to the PLAAF. Chinese Air Force and later Naval Air Force are highly satisfied with the aircraft's all-around performance, high reliability, cost-effectiveness, as well as its great multi-role update potentials, easy maintainability, and a service life of over 10,000 flying hours.[9][10]In November 2012, an order for twelve JL-10s by an unknown customer was announced, due to be delivered in 2013.[16] This batch of JL-10 began delivery to the customer on June 29, 2013.[17]In August 2018, according to the photos in the article, at least twelve JL-10 have been delivered to Navy Aviation university.[18]Data from Military-Today[24]（estimate）[25]L-15A[6]General characteristicsPerformanceAvionicsAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era", 'attributes': None}

{'keyword': '航空母舰', 'source': 'wiki', 'title': None, 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi', 'date': 202110180430, 'content': "The Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK; Chinese: 汉语水平考试; pinyin: Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì), translated as the Chinese Proficiency Test,[1] is the standardized test of Standard Chinese (a type of Mandarin Chinese) language proficiency of  Mainland China for non-native speakers such as foreign students and overseas Chinese. The test is administered by the Hanban, an agency of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China.The test cannot be taken in Taiwan, where only the Taiwan's TOCFL exam can be taken. The TOCFL exam is not available in Mainland China, vice versa.Development began in 1984 at Beijing Language and Culture University and in 1992 the HSK was officially made a national standardized test. By 2005, over 120 countries had participated as regular host sites and the tests had been taken around 100 million times (domestic ethnic minority candidates included).[2] The general count of candidates from outside of China is stated as being around 1.9 million.[3] In 2011, Beijing International Chinese College became the first HSK testing center to conduct the HSK test online.The HSK test is analogous to the English TOEFL, and an HSK certificate is valid without any limitation in China. The test aims to be a certificate of language proficiency for higher educational and professional purposes. It is not uncommon to refer to a standard or level of proficiency by the HSK level number, or score. For example, a job description might ask for foreign applicants with 'HSK5 or better.'The HSK is administered solely in Mandarin and in simplified Chinese characters; however, if the exam is paper-based, the test-taker can choose to write the writing assignments in simplified or in traditional characters, at their discretion.[4] The test can be either paper-based or Internet-based, depending on what the specific test center offers. With an Internet-based test, the writing part with characters (from HSK 3 on) is subjectively and slightly easier, as one types the pinyin and selects the right character from the list, while with a paper-based test, one must remember the characters, their strokes and their order, and write them out.Test takers with outstanding results can win a scholarship for short-term language study in China.In 2020, an internal Chinese academic paper discussed that the Chinese Proficiency Standards shall usher in a new change: a hybrid paradigm of “Three Stages and Nine Levels” characterized by integration and all-in-one. The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China announced further details regarding HSK 3.0 on April 1, 2021. Among the information shared was a wordlist for each individual stage, and a date for the introduction of the new test - July 1, 2021.[5]The new test is meant to follow the latest research in the field of language studies and testing. The basic levels (roughly corresponding to CEFR A1/A2)[citation needed] should test from 500 to 2245 words, the intermediate levels (roughly corresponding to CEFR B1/B2)[citation needed] from 3245 to 5456 words, the advanced levels (roughly corresponding to CEFR C1/C2)[citation needed] from about 6000 to 11000 words.[6][7] The intermediate levels should test the ability to understand slightly modified authentic materials or authentic materials written/spoken in a clear manner and intended for educated mother tongue speakers: materials concerning everyday topics, simple articles, simple commentaries and critiques found in newspapers and magazines.The advanced levels should test the ability to understand longer, more complicated and abstract materials: extracts from authentic sources such as textbooks for Chinese university students, Chinese magazine and essays, extracts from modern Chinese literature, interviews and extracts from Chinese media. Moreover, classical Chinese expressions and classical Chinese grammatical structures used in modern formal Chinese should be included too.The current format was introduced in 2010, with a philosophy of testing 'comprehensive language and communication ability'.[1] Most notable is the inclusion of written segments at all levels (not just Advanced, as in the pre-2010 test), reformation of the ranking system, and use of new question structures. Complete vocabulary lists, previous tests, and simulated tests are available as preparation materials. A minor update of the vocabulary lists was made in 2012.The HSK consists of a written test and an oral test, which are taken separately. This oral test is also known as the HSKK or 汉语水平口语考试.[8][9]The Listening, Reading and Writing tests each have a maximum score of 100. HSK 1 and 2 therefore have a maximum score of 200 with 120 points required to pass.[14][15] HSK 3 and 4 have a maximum of 300 points with 180 points required to pass.[16][17] There is no minimum number of points required for each of the sections as long as the sum is over 120 or 180 points respectively.HSK 5 and 6 also have a maximum of 300 points and originally required a score of 180 points to pass.[18][19] However, since a decision made in February 2013, there has been no official passing score for either HSK 5 or 6.[20]Hanban provides examples of the exam for the different levels together with a list of words that need to be known for each level.[21] These examples are also available (together with the audio for the Listening Test) on the websites of the Confucius Institute at QUT[22] and HSK Academy.[23]The written version is now available in two forms, a computer and a paper based test. Both tests are still held at test centers, the differences between the two are as follows:[24]The HSKK test is a separate test. However, the three HSKK levels correspond with the six HSK levels of the written test.In 2010, Hanban asserted that the HSK's six levels corresponded to the six levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR)[11][25] However, the German[26]:\u200a1,\u200a3,\u200a5\u200a and French[27] associations of Chinese language teachers reject this equivalency, arguing that HSK Level 6 is only equivalent to CEFR Level B2 or C1.AdvancedElementary/IntermediateBasicFormerly, there were 11 possible ranks (1-11) and 3 test formats (Basic, Elementary/Intermediate, and Advanced). A rank of between 3 and 8 was needed to enroll in a Chinese university, depending on the subject being studied. A score of 9 or higher was a common business standard.[citation needed]A student taking the Basic test (基础HSK) could  attain a rank of 1 through 3 (1级-3级), or fail to meet requirements and thus not receive a rank. The Elementary/Intermediate test (初中等HSK) covered ranks 3-8 (3级-8级), with ranks below 3 not considered. Likewise, the Advanced test (高等HSK) covered ranks 9-11 (9级-11级), with scores below 9 not considered.The previous format for both Basic and Elementary/Intermediate HSK included four sections: listening comprehension, grammar structures, reading comprehension, and written expressions. Aside from the written expressions portion (which requires writing of Chinese characters), these two tests were completely multiple-choice. The Advanced HSK however, added an additional two portions: spoken and written.The HSK is held at designated test centers in China and abroad.[36] A list of test centers can be found at the HSK website.[37] Test dates are published annually and written tests are more frequently held than spoken ones, generally around once a month, depending on the test center. Test registration is usually open until 30 days prior to the actual test date for the paper-based test or around 10 days prior the actual test date for the computer-based test.

{'keyword': '航空母舰', 'source': 'wiki', 'title': None, 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantai_Collection', 'date': 202110080724, 'content': "Kantai Collection (Japanese: 艦隊これくしょん, Hepburn: Kantai Korekushon, lit. 'Fleet Collection'),[a] abbreviated as KanColle (艦これ, KanKore), is a Japanese free-to-play web browser game developed by Kadokawa Games and published by DMM.com.[2][3]The central theme of the game is the representation of World War II warships personified as teenage girls and young adult women with personality characteristics reflecting the history of each ship. Originally, all of these were Japanese, but ships from other nations have also been added as the game has developed. Gameplay involves all aspects of naval warfare, including not only combat but also maintenance, repair, upgrading, resupply, morale, logistics and mission planning.The game was launched on April 23, 2013.[4] As of April 2015, the game is available in Japan only and has 3 million registered players.[5] An Android client of the original game was released in 2016.[6] The game has developed into a much larger media franchise; various media including multiple manga series and light novels have been released, in addition to an officially licensed tabletop role-playing game. A PlayStation Vita game was released in February 2016,[7] and an anime television series aired its first season from January to March 2015,[8] with an animated film[9] released in November 2016 and a second season announced in 2019.The gameplay is centered upon building squadrons composed of individual characters represented as cards with different attributes, and then sending said squadrons out on missions. Each of the characters are moe anthropomorphisms of World War II naval warships which are depicted as cute girls, known as 'Fleet girls' (艦娘, kanmusu).[10] These personified warships are based on real-life vessels which are explained in detail within the game; the physical characteristics, appearances and personalities of each of the girls correlate in some way to the real-life vessel (for example, ships with a larger displacement tonnage such as cruisers, battleships and aircraft carriers are usually depicted as young women, while smaller ships such as destroyers and coastal defense ships look and behave like pubescent girls, with a few exceptions). The vast majority of these fleet girls were based on the ships of Imperial Japanese Navy along with few that were based on other navies' warships instead, including three from Imperial Japanese Army. So far foreign navies represented in the game are include Kriegsmarine, Regia Marina, United States Navy, Royal Navy, Soviet Navy, Marine Nationale, Svenska Marinen, Royal Australian Navy and Koninklijke Marine. The player takes on the role of an admiral (提督, teitoku) and organizes their fleets in battle in order to win. Combat is largely automated, and manual actions by the player include micromanagement such as building and repairing.[2][11] The player can organise up to four different fleets.[12]The player progresses through the game by advancing through maps, gaining experience points through grinding, obtaining new fleet girls whilst repairing and resupplying existing ones, and fulfilling quests to obtain resources. New equipment can be crafted, allowing the fleet girls to equip different armaments depending on the situation.[10] Acquisition of new kanmusu by the player can occur via drops on map or via crafting, and is heavily RNG-based; randomization is also a key component of the battle mechanism, map progression and equipment development.[12] Construction, resupply and repair of ships is reliant upon four types of resources, namely fuel, ammunition, steel and bauxite; these supplies will gradually increase automatically as time passes. Players can choose to engage in expeditions, sorties, and quests to further increase their supplies as well.[12]Ships can be customised through the addition of various equipment within their empty slots, which add attribute bonuses and even provide special effects in some cases;[10] such equipment include naval guns, anti-aircraft guns, torpedoes, torpedo bombers, dive bombers, fighter aircraft, seaplanes, recon planes, radars, steam turbines, special artillery shells, depth charges, sonars, drum canisters, searchlights and anti-torpedo bulges. The effectiveness of ships in combat depend on its attribute parameters, namely hitpoints, armour, evasion, aircraft capacity, speed, attack range, firepower, torpedo, anti-air, anti-submarine, line-of-sight, and luck.[13]Kanmusu are capable of becoming stronger as they gain experience and level up after battles, and can also be remodeled into more advanced models once they reach a certain level. Unwanted kanmusu can also be 'fed' to other kanmusu through a process known as 'modernization' (近代化改修, kindaika kaishu), which grants attribute bonuses to one ship in exchange for losing another.[12] Ships can become fatigued once it accumulates after sorties; fatigued ships have decreased attributes, whilst sparkling ships have increased attributes. Fatigue can be alleviated by allowing ships some time to rest, or by recovering the fleet's morale using Japanese food supply ship\xa0Mamiya. As ships become damaged, their icons begin to blow off smoke and their clothing become visually torn and battered; in the event when a ship's durability drops down to zero, it is considered sunk, and the player will lose the fleet girl.[12] Players cannot resurrect fleet girls that have been lost unless they are in possession of an emergency repair item, and are only able to re-train ships that have been lost from scratch.Whilst the game is free-to-play, special premium bonuses can be obtained through prepaid game money and credit card microtransactions, such as repair dock expansions, home shipyard furniture tokens, ship possession limit increases, and special consumable items.[14] Although each ship in the game has an experience level cap of Lv.99, the player is able to obtain the 'marriage papers and ring' item with a monetary purchase priced at 700 yen or via a one-time special quest, which allows the player to 'marry' the girl, thereby breaking the original level cap and allowing a new maximum of Lv.175, in addition to other perks such as stat boosts and decreased operating costs; this process can be repeated as many times as the player wishes, and there is no limit to the number of girls that can be 'married'.[15]Players can choose to battle against the fleets of other real-life players on the same game server via the exercise maneuvers menu. Players are also able to compete with each other's scores via in-game ranking boards, with periodical prizes for top ranking players. As of January 2016, there are 20 servers that can be played on, each named after a World War II-era Japanese naval base.[13] The game is currently intended to be played by a Japanese domestic audience only, with the interface exclusively in the Japanese language. As of present, the game cannot be played outside Japan without the use of a VPN;[16] utilisation of such methods to circumvent country IP restrictions and access the game breach the DMM.com online game terms of use, however.[17] From August 2013 onwards, new player registrations were only available via periodic lottery, due to the servers being overloaded by large numbers of new registrants.[18] After July 2015, new registrants were able to join the 20th server without the need to partake in a lottery; due to excessive player numbers, however, the new server has closed on multiple occasions.Upon the debut of the game, there were a total of 94 different fleet girls available. Within an update introduced May 15–17, 2013, additional fleet girls were added. On September 11, 2013, the first non-Japanese vessel, Soviet destroyer Verniy (Верный), was introduced into the game.[19] There were plans during the early stages to eventually bring additional ships from other countries,[20] and in March 2014, three German Kriegsmarine vessels were added.[21] Two Italian ships were added as part of the 2015 Spring event in April 2015,[22] with one more added in August.[23] The first fully non-Axis ship, the American USS Iowa (BB-61), was introduced with KanColle Kai on February 18, 2016,[24] later becoming available in the browser game's 2016 Spring event.[25] Presently there are 164 original girls in addition to 72 upgraded variants, bringing the total number of fleet girls to 236. The game currently holds spaces for 250 different types of fleet girls. Different fleet girls are illustrated by different artists; artists involved in the drawing of various characters include Shibafu,[26][27] Yoshinori Shizuma,[28] Konishi,[28] Kūrokuro,[28][29] Akemi Mikoto[1] and 16 other artists. Fumikane Shimada, who was previously the lead character designer for Strike Witches and Girls und Panzer, created the designs and illustrations for Japanese armored aircraft carrier Taihō[30] and the five German vessels.[31]The traits of each fleet girl are based on aspects of the historical ship they are based on; for instance, Japanese battleship\xa0Kongō frequently adds English words and phrases into her dialog as a reference to her British origins, whilst Japanese destroyer\xa0Shimakaze is depicted as a speedy girl in artworks and official print media, since Shimakaze was one of the fastest destroyer ships of World War II.[32] Characters which share particular links also have similar physical traits: ships of the same class may have similar accessories or clothing, whilst all Imperial Japanese Navy submarines are depicted as wearing sukumizu.Voice actors have been employed to voice the fleet girls, with anywhere around 10 fleet girls being voiced by one actor.Prior to Kantai Collection, the majority of games published by DMM.com were R-18+ adult online games. In an effort to attract customers from a wider audience, DMM.com experimented with Kantai Collection in partnership with Kadokawa Games; by November 2013, Kantai Collection accounted for 30-40% of DMM.com's total online game business.[33]Unlike other online games in Japan, Kantai Collection was designed with the intention of not forcing the player to spend money or participate in 'gacha' lotteries.[34][35] The purpose of this stems from Kadokawa desiring a larger target market and to establish the game as a well-known name, eventually allowing for merchandising and sales of franchise works.[36]Kensuke Tanaka, who prior to Kantai Collection was involved in the production and public relations for Final Fantasy X, XI and XIII, wished to create a game which involves historical elements while still appealing to the regular fans of DMM.com, namely fans of anime and manga culture, and this led him to the idea of developing a game centered on anthropomorphisms of warships.A bi-monthly online web manga by Ryōta Momoi began serialization from April 23, 2013, in the Famitsu Comic Clear. The manga follows a 4koma format, and features a storyline with the fleet girls enrolled in schools, where senior girls teach battle techniques to their juniors. It has been updated weekly since October 2013.[37][38] Ryōta Momoi's 4koma manga will be released in print book format under the title KanColle 4 cell comic: Fubuki, I will do my best!

Gambier Bay uses the opportunity as a way of learning to get over her fear of the Kurita Fleet, as well to pull herself out of being too self-deprecating. Two volumes of the collected chapters have been released, and the third volume is scheduled to be released in September 2020. Currently it's also available on Comic Walker since July 10, 2019.[51]Kadokawa has also announced a manga series titled KanColle: Black Order (provisional) (艦隊これくしょん -艦これ- ブラックオーダー（仮）, Black Order (kari)), created by Ōto Taguchi who was previously responsible for the Mobile Suit Gundam 00 manga.[52] However, the project was cancelled after a disagreement between the author and publisher.[53]Famitsu Comic Clear, DNA Comics, Comptiq and Dengeki Comics have also published numerous series of comic compilation books which each contain a collection of various one-shot manga.A short story series featuring aircraft carriers Zuikaku and Shōkaku written by Hiroki Uchida and illustrated by Matarō, titled KanColle: Bonds of the Wings of Cranes (艦隊これくしょん -艦これ- 鶴翼の絆, Kakuyoku no kizuna), began serialization within the January 2014 issue (released November 20, 2013) of Dragon Magazine.[43]A light novel based on the game with the title KanColle: Kagerō, Setting Sail!

Existing functions from the original web browser game are also present, with major user interface changes.[58] Menu screens feature Live2D character animations, and the player will encounter a 'game over' state if all of their territories are destroyed by the enemy. The Vita game contained the original debut of USS Iowa (BB-61) as a playable ship, prior to her seasonal event implementation within the browser game.[24]In March 2014, financial analyst Fukuda Sōichirō of Citigroup Global Markets Japan made the prediction in a stock investor report that the PS Vita game would ship 500,000 copies, and expects that a profit of 1 billion yen be made. He also cites the ability to charge players for in-game premium items on the PS Vita platform as an upside for Kadokawa Corporation business-wise.[59] Famitsu gave the game a review score of 29/40.[60] The game sold 140,757 physical retail copies within the first week of release in Japan, placing first within the Japanese software sales rankings for that particular week;[61] Dengeki Online and Famitsu both report that between 80-100% of the initial retail batch stock was sold out within the first week.[62][63]Kadokawa Games has announced that the game will be no longer sold physically in retail stores or digitally in the PlayStation Store by the end of January 2017.[64]KanColle Arcade (艦これアーケード) is a trading card arcade game developed by Sega AM2 and launched on April 26, 2016.[65][66] The game features fully modeled 3D characters, and involves the player taking control of the direction and speed of their ship in combat against Abyssal ships, in addition to collecting different shipgirls.

Not only do the stories differ, but also the depictions and interpretations of fleet girls and the manner in which they engage in combat. The game does not strictly define anything relating to its setting, allowing for a greater diversity of secondary literary adaptation works which cater to different audiences, and more artistic freedom among secondary works which can approach the setting of Kantai Collection differently.Kadokawa has not officially announced whether any secondary work is absolute canon, nor have they released significant quantities of canonical material, with some official works even contradicting one another. For instance, some manga anthology depictions show the ship girls as ship-sized giants, while other serialized manga show them as human-sized. The television animation explains the ship girls as humans born with the ability to possess the spirits of World War II warships, while within the Bonds of the Wings of Cranes light novel, the girls refer to themselves as actual warships, and that their origin is unknown.Season two of the anime is still in the works.[81]Within the story of the light novel Bonds of the Wings of Cranes, the setting is within an alternate universe where World War II never took place. The fleet of the Abyss, consisting of monster ships, lock down access to the seas and indiscriminately fire upon vessels and aircraft, and feed on the corpses of dead sailors in the water.[82] The large number of abyssals, along with their regenerating ability, allowed them to easily defeat the conventional navies and modern militaries of the world. Ship girls are the guardians of humanity and human-weapon hybrids that are summoned using spirit energy (霊力), with female forms as the ships they represent have female souls.[83] Zuikaku, having taken a humanoid form, remembers a time where she was once a ship, however, does not know the reason behind her human form.The fleet girls live within an old-fashioned Japanese-style hotel which doubles as the girls' dormitory and is close to a nearby factory which services combat equipment.[84] The admiral of the fleet is a young man who behaves like a pervert, fond of groping the ship girls and playing with their skirts, although his personality does become serious when commanding the fleet. As the ship girls and abyssal fleets engage in combat, both sides are guarded by a protective barrier. The aircraft carriers Akagi and Kaga are depicted as firing archery arrows from a bow which then transform into fighter planes. Armaments are detachable equipment, and when not in combat gear the ships otherwise appear as ordinary girls.[85]This light novel is set within a universe based on the real world, where normal girls undergo training to become ship girls. Hundreds of warships were destroyed by abyssal forces which spontaneously emerge from anywhere under the sea, and as a result, ship girls are employed to counter the threat.[86]A series of mini-arcs connecting a ship girl to her existing counterpart by gradually introducing characters and rotating the leads. Within this manga, ship girls are depicted as flying on the water surface whilst in combat against the abyss fleet of monster ships, and launch aircraft managed by tiny fairies in a conventional takeoff manner from their body attachments. Artillery and torpedo combat is shown to be performed at long range, whilst anti-submarine warfare takes place in close quarters.This manga adaptation focuses on the adventures of the Tenryū class and Akatsuki class, as it follows the newly assigned Tenryū and her new squadron in solving the mystery of the Abyssal Fleet.This manga depicts the story of a newly appointed, rookie officer by the name of Ensign Akai who arrives at the Maizuru Naval Base for duty as the assistant to the vice-admiral, however has to deal with a stubborn and difficult Shimakaze who spends most of her time alone, and does not have any friends. Multiple nations around the world have developed ship girls for their navy power, and Maizuru is one of the major bases of Japan responsible for managing them.[87]This slice of life 4koma depicts the everyday life of the ship girls at the fleet training school, where newly manufactured ship girls spend one year learning knowledge before setting out to sea. Most of the scenarios are taken from the point of view of Fubuki, and feature the girls doing fun things with one another, which include attending school, drinking tea, celebrating various holidays like Tanabata, Halloween and Christmas, in addition to the occasional sortie. The ship girls retain memories of their previous lives from World War II, at times displaying signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. References to their personal histories and characteristics are common and usually used to comedic effect. This manga depicts the ship girls as being able to walk on the surface of the water in a manner akin to ice-skating, just like in the anime series.Merchandise based on the game have been launched as a result of the success of the online game, proliferation of derivative works, and strong interest in the franchise. PVC figurines have been released, including Nendoroid and Figma figurines of both Shimakaze and Akagi,[88][89] in addition to a 1/7 scale PVC display figurine of a severely damaged Kongō designed and manufactured by Max Factory.[90] An expansion for a trading card game Weiß Schwarz based on Kancolle theme was released on March 28, 2014, and reportedly sold 1.7 million packets within its first shipment.[91]In September 2013, a collaborative project between Kantai Collection and the Arpeggio of Blue Steel anime was announced.[92] Illustrators for Kantai Collection are responsible for drawing some of the anime end cards for Arpeggio of Blue Steel, which feature crossovers with Kantai Collection characters.[93] An Arpeggio of Blue Steel in-game special event for Kantai Collection also took place from December 24, 2013, to January 8, 2014.[94]Due to the high popularity of the game within Japan, game operators created larger numbers of servers in early 2013 to cope with the influx of players.[2] During August 2013, the number of new players spiked by 100,000 people within one week, to a total of 600,000 people, with 350,000 daily active players.[18] By September 2013, it was reported that there were more than 800,000 players regularly active.[19] The total number of players broke 1,000,000 on 9 October 2013.[95] As of April 2015, there were 3 million players.[5] One commonly cited explanation behind the success of the game is that players aren't forced to spend money to play, unlike other popular Japanese online games; the free-to-play nature of Kantai Collection makes in-game purchases optional, and not a necessity.[12] It is estimated that on average, Kantai Collection players spend less money on the game compared to the popular Japanese games Puzzle & Dragons, The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls and Love Live! School Idol Festival.[96]Interest in Kantai Collection has significantly risen over the months following its release, to the point where it has often been compared with the fandom of Touhou Project as an emerging viral fandom. There has been a large increase in online activity and fan-created material relating to the game, such as fan-made artworks, doujinshi and other derivative content.[102][103] As of April 2015, there are over 345,000 different artworks on Pixiv tagged with 'KanColle' created by 67,000 individual artists, and KanColle-related videos on Niconico were watched 460 million times.[5] During Comiket 85, there were 1,136 dōjin circles producing works for Kantai Collection, placing third behind Touhou Project (2,272 circles) and Kuroko's Basketball (1,462 circles), and ahead of The Idolmaster and Vocaloid;[97][104] this is a significant increase over the previous Comiket 84 event, which only had just over 100 circles with Kantai Collection works.[98] Dōjin material relating to the game have also gained traction overseas; KanColle-exclusive dōjin events have been held in Shanghai on 22 February 2014,[105] and Taipei on 29 March 2014.[106]On 12 December 2013, Twitter officially released the top hashtags of 2013; #艦これ was the most used hashtag among Japanese Twitter users.[107][108] The game was also the eighth most searched term within Japan on Google in 2013.[109] On 30 December 2013, GameSpark named Kantai Collection as the online game category title for its game of the year awards of 2013, ahead of runners-up League of Legends, World of Tanks and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.[110] A survey of 151 different prominent Japanese game developers conducted by 4gamer asked what each developer considered to be the best game of 2013; nine of these developers selected Kantai Collection. Among these developers, Naoki Yoshida of Square Enix, who produced and directed Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, stated that Kantai Collection is Japan's answer to World of Tanks, and that he was impressed by the business model;[111] meanwhile, Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA director Seiji Hayashi of Sega referred to the game as 'innovative'.[112] Kantai Collection was named 'Rookie of the Year' during the WebMoney 2013 Awards, as a new entrant to the games market.[113]Speaking at a symposium held by Kadokawa ASCII Research Institute on 27 September 2013, the chairman of the board of directors of Kadokawa Group Holdings, Tsuguhiko Kadokawa, stated that despite the game's popularity, Kantai Collection is nearly unprofitable for the company, in part due to the game being funded by various company partnerships, such as the profit-sharing agreement made between Kadokawa Group and DMM Group, given that none of the game's development fees were paid for by Kadokawa. Kadokawa's stock price rose by 1000 yen within June 2013, following the initial rise of the game. It is expected that Kadokawa will need to rely on sales of intellectual property media works such as books and manga in order to raise profits.[36] Kadokawa Games president Yoshimi Yasuda affirms that the free-to-play business model of the game will not change despite reports of a lack of revenue gain.[114]Meanwhile, game distributor DMM Corporation gained 7 billion yen from the game as of June 2014, which is equivalent to 140 times the value of the game's development costs.[115]Toshihiko Tsukiji's light novel Kantai Collection: Kagerō, Setting Sail! sold 16,624 copies within its first week of release, placing 11th place within the Oricon book ranking charts.[116] Also debuting the same week were the Sasebo Naval District Compilation Vol.1 and Maizuru Naval District Compilation Vol.1 comic anthologies, which sold 59,552 copies and 58,110 copies respectively.[117] In mid-November 2013, Yokosuka Naval District Compilation Vol.1 sold 48,909 copies during its first week, placing 10th place among all comic sales.[118] The first manga volume of Fubuki, Ganbarimasu! sold 28,324 copies within its first week in December 2013.[119] The KanColle White Paper official book published by Kadokawa placed third overall within the Oricon book charts during its debut week in October 2013, selling 46,039 copies.[120]An editorial within the South Korean Hankook Ilbo on 4 November 2013 accuses that the strong popularity of the game is due to a conservative political shift amongst young people in Japan following long-term economic recession and political instability, and that the game glorifies the wartime Imperial Japanese Navy.[121] Addressing the Hankook Ilbo allegation, Akky Akimoto writing for The Japan Times disagrees with the idea that the game's design deliberately facilitates any political shift, and argues that the 1970s anime series Space Battleship Yamato was subject to similar criticisms despite having little effect on domestic politics.[122]Another opinion piece from the Asahi Shimbun suggests that the game's unforgiving mechanics, such as ships permanently sinking, some of them may even trace for their grandparents' military service history, so helps players understand the brutality of war given the desperate situations, that they can gain a more positive understanding of history or even oppose conflict itself.[123]In January 2015, allegations arose that the company Beijing Longzhu Digital Technology (北京龙珠数码科技),[124] which runs an unofficial pirated KanColle server in Mainland China, spent CN¥700,000 (US$112,800) in purchasing various Chinese-language KanColle internet forums such as the KanColle subforum on Baidu Tieba; online discussion boards intended for discussing the original Japanese game were closed down or placed under new management, while the forums of the pirated bootleg Chinese KanColle remained online. This led to widespread unrest amongst Chinese players of the original game, resulting in large-scale internet raids on forums and social media, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and website defacing via SQL injection[125] by hackers against those running the bootleg server.[126][127] An article published by China Central Television referred to the incident as the largest online mass boycott and protest against intellectual property infringement in China, and a wake-up call for the Chinese gaming industry as a whole to strive for integrity and refrain from creating copycat works.[128]", 'attributes': None}

She loves Korean pop.' She also told the international media that she planned to 'dial it up' and watch the video.[207]A few weeks later Nuland described 'Gangnam Style' as 'fantastic' and added that both her daughter and her husband Robert Kagan 'all love the Gangnam Style' and that she had mastered its dance moves by watching the video clip 'for weeks and weeks.'[208]On October 9, Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, held a speech at the 2012 Conservative Party Conference, where he admitted that 'Gangnam Style is very good'.[209] He talked about the vast variety of exports that originate from London, including television aerials which the Koreans use to watch 'Gangnam Style'.

He hailed the song as a 'force for world peace' and added that 'there are no languages required in the musical world. That is the power of music, that is the power of the heart.

It is bounded in the north by the shores of South China (hence the name), in the west by the Indochinese Peninsula, in the east by the islands of Taiwan and northwestern Philippines (mainly Luzon, Mindoro and Palawan), and in the south by Borneo, eastern Sumatra and the Bangka Belitung Islands, encompassing an area of around 3,500,000\xa0km2 (1,400,000\xa0sq\xa0mi).  It communicates with the East China Sea via the Taiwan Strait, the Philippine Sea via the Luzon Strait, the Sulu Sea via the straits around Palawan (e.g. the Mindoro and Balabac Strait), the Strait of Malacca via the Strait of Singapore, and the Java Sea via the Karimata and Bangka Strait. The Gulf of Thailand and the Gulf of Tonkin are also part of the South China Sea. The shallow waters south of the Riau Islands are also known as the Natuna Sea.The South China Sea is a region of tremendous economic and geostrategic importance.  One-third of the world's maritime shipping passes through it, carrying over US$3 trillion in trade each year.[1]  Huge oil and natural gas reserves are believed to lie beneath its seabed.[2]  It also contain lucrative fisheries, which are crucial for the food security of millions in Southeast Asia.The South China Sea Islands, collectively comprising several archipelago clusters of mostly small uninhabited islands, islets (cays and shoals), reefs/atolls and seamounts numbering in the hundreds, are subject to competing claims of sovereignty by several countries. These claims are also reflected in the variety of names used for the islands and the sea.South China Sea is the dominant term used in English for the sea, and the name in most European languages is equivalent. This name is a result of early European interest in the sea as a route from Europe and South Asia to the trading opportunities of China. In the sixteenth century Portuguese sailors called it the China Sea (Mare da China); later needs to differentiate it from nearby bodies of water led to calling it the South China Sea.[4] The International Hydrographic Organization refers to the sea as 'South China Sea (Nan Hai)'.[5]The Yizhoushu, which was a chronicle of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BCE), gives the first Chinese name for the South China Sea as Nanfang Hai (Chinese: 南方海; pinyin: Nánfāng Hǎi; lit. 'Southern Sea'), claiming that barbarians from that sea gave tributes of hawksbill sea turtles to the Zhou rulers.[6] The Classic of Poetry, Zuo Zhuan, and Guoyu classics of the Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BCE) also referred to the sea, but by the name Nan Hai (Chinese: 南海; pinyin: Nán Hǎi; lit. 'South Sea') in reference to the State of Chu's expeditions there.[6] Nan Hai, the South Sea, was one of the Four Seas of Chinese literature. There are three other seas, one for each of the four cardinal directions.[7] During the Eastern Han dynasty (23–220 CE), China's rulers called the sea Zhang Hai (Chinese: 漲海; pinyin: Zhǎng Hǎi; lit. 'distended sea').[6] Fei Hai (Chinese: 沸海; pinyin: Fèi Hǎi; lit. 'boil sea') became popular during the Southern and Northern Dynasties period. Usage of the current Chinese name, Nan Hai (South Sea), gradually became widespread during the Qing Dynasty.[8]In Southeast Asia it was once called the Champa Sea or Sea of Cham, after the maritime kingdom of Champa, which flourished there before the sixteenth century.[9] The majority of the sea came under Japanese naval control during World War II following the military acquisition of many surrounding South East Asian territories in 1941. Japan calls the sea Minami Shina Kai 'South China Sea'. This was written 南支那海 until 2004, when the Japanese Foreign Ministry and other departments switched the spelling to 南シナ海, which has become the standard usage in Japan. 'West Philippine Sea' is the official designation by the Philippine government of eastern parts of the South China Sea that are included in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. The term is also sometimes incorrectly used to refer to the South China Sea as a whole.In China, it is called the 'South Sea', 南海 (Nánhǎi), and in Vietnam the 'East Sea', Biển Đông.[10][11][12]  In Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, it was long called the 'South China Sea' (Dagat Timog Tsina in Tagalog, Laut China Selatan in Malay), with the part within Philippine territorial waters often called the 'Luzon Sea', Dagat Luzon, by the Philippines.[13] However, following an escalation of the Spratly Islands dispute in 2011, various Philippine government agencies started using the name West Philippine Sea. A Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) spokesperson said that the sea to the east of the Philippines will continue to be called the Philippine Sea.[14] In September 2012, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III signed Administrative Order No. 29, mandating that all government agencies use the name West Philippine Sea to refer to the parts of the South China Sea within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, including the Luzon Sea as well as the waters around, within and adjacent to the Kalayaan Island Group and Bajo de Masinloc, and tasked the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA) to use the name in official maps.[15][16]In July 2017, to assert its sovereignty, Indonesia renamed the northern reaches of its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea as the 'North Natuna Sea', which is located north of the Indonesian Natuna Islands, bordering the southern Vietnam exclusive economic zone, corresponding to the southern end of the South China Sea.[17] The 'Natuna Sea' is located south of Natuna Island within Indonesian territorial waters.[18] Therefore, Indonesia has named two seas that are portions of the South China Sea; the Natuna Sea located between Natuna Islands and the Lingga and Tambelan Archipelagos, and the North Natuna Sea located between the Natuna Islands and Cape Cà Mau on the southern tip of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam.According to International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition (1953), it is located[5][failed verification].However, in its unapproved draft 4th edition (1986),[19] IHO proposed the Natuna Sea, thus the South China Sea southern boundary was shifted northward, from north of the Bangka Belitung Islands to north and northeast of Natuna Islands.[20]States and territories with borders on the sea (clockwise from north) include: the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Vietnam.Major rivers that flow into the South China Sea include the Pearl, Min, Jiulong, Red, Mekong, Rajang, Pahang, Agno, Pampanga, and Pasig Rivers.The International Hydrographic Organization in its Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition (1953), defines the limits of the South China Sea as follows:[5]On the South. The Eastern and Southern limits of Singapore and Malacca Straits [A line joining Tanjong Datok, the Southeast point of Johore (1°22′N 104°17′E\ufeff / \ufeff1.367°N 104.283°E\ufeff / 1.367; 104.283) through Horsburgh Reef to Pulo Koko, the Northeastern extreme of Bintan Island (1°13.5′N 104°35′E\ufeff / \ufeff1.2250°N 104.583°E\ufeff / 1.2250; 104.583). The Northeastern coast of Sumatra] as far West as Tanjong Kedabu (1°06′N 102°58′E\ufeff / \ufeff1.100°N 102.967°E\ufeff / 1.100; 102.967) down the East coast of Sumatra to Lucipara Point (3°14′S 106°05′E\ufeff / \ufeff3.233°S 106.083°E\ufeff / -3.233; 106.083) thence to Tanjong Nanka, the Southwest extremity of Banka Island (where it transitions as Java Sea), through this island to Tanjong Berikat the Eastern point (2°34′S 106°51′E\ufeff / \ufeff2.567°S 106.850°E\ufeff / -2.567; 106.850), on to Tanjong Djemang (2°36′S 107°37′E\ufeff / \ufeff2.600°S 107.617°E\ufeff / -2.600; 107.617) in Billiton, along the North coast of this island to Tanjong Boeroeng Mandi (2°46′S 108°16′E\ufeff / \ufeff2.767°S 108.267°E\ufeff / -2.767; 108.267) and thence a line to Tanjong Sambar (3°00′S 110°19′E\ufeff / \ufeff3.000°S 110.317°E\ufeff / -3.000; 110.317) the Southwest extreme of Borneo.On the East. From Tanjong Sambar through the West coast of Borneo to Tanjong Sampanmangio, the North point, thence a line to West points of Balabac and Secam Reefs, on to the West point of Bancalan Island and to Cape Buliluyan, the Southwest point of Palawan, through this island to Cabuli Point, the Northern point thereof, thence to the Northwest point of Busuanga and to Cape Calavite in the island of Mindoro, to the Northwest point of Lubang Island and to Point Fuego (14°08'N) in Luzon Island, through this island to Cape Engano, the Northeast point of Luzon, along a line joining this cape with the East point of Balintang Island (20°N) and to the East point of Y'Ami Island (21°05'N) thence to Garan Bi, the Southern point of Taiwan (Formosa), through this island to Santyo (25°N) its North Eastern Point.On the North. From Fuki Kaku the North point of Formosa to Kiushan Tao (Turnabout Island) on to the South point of Haitan Tao (25°25'N) and thence Westward on the parallel of 25°24' North to the coast of Fukien.On the West. The Mainland, the Southern limit of the Gulf of Thailand and the East coast of the Malay Peninsula.However, in a revised edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas, 4th edition (1986), the International Hydrographic Organization officially recognized the Natuna Sea. Thus the southern limit of South China Sea is revised from the Bangka Belitung Islands to the Natuna Islands.[20]The sea lies above a drowned continental shelf; during recent ice ages global sea level was hundreds of metres lower, and Borneo was part of the Asian mainland.The South China Sea opened around 45 million years ago when the 'Dangerous Ground' rifted away from southern China. Extension culminated in seafloor spreading around 30 million years ago, a process that propagated to the SW resulting in the V-shaped basin we see today. Extension ceased around 17 million years ago.[21] Arguments have continued about the role of tectonic extrusion in forming the basin. Paul Tapponnier and colleagues have argued that as India collides with Asia it pushes Indochina to the SE. The relative shear between Indochina and China caused the South China Sea to open.[22] This view is disputed by geologists[who?] who do not consider Indochina to have moved far relative to mainland Asia. Marine geophysical studies in the Gulf of Tonkin by Peter Clift has shown that the Red River Fault was active and causing basin formation at least by 37 million years ago in the NW South China Sea, consistent with extrusion playing a part in the formation of the sea. Since opening the South China Sea has been the repository of large sediment volumes delivered by the Mekong River, Red River and Pearl River. Several of these deltas are rich in oil and gas deposits.The South China Sea contains over 250 small islands, atolls, cays, shoals, reefs, and sandbars, most of which have no indigenous people, many of which are naturally under water at high tide, and some of which are permanently submerged. The features are:The Spratly Islands spread over an 810 by 900\xa0km area covering some 175 identified insular features, the largest being Taiping Island (Itu Aba) at just over 1.3 kilometres (0.81\xa0mi) long and with its highest elevation at 3.8 metres (12\xa0ft).The largest singular feature in the area of the Spratly Islands is a 100 kilometres (62\xa0mi) wide seamount called Reed Tablemount, also known as Reed Bank, in the northeast of the group, separated from Palawan Island of the Philippines by the Palawan Trench. Now completely submerged, with a depth of 20 metres (66\xa0ft), it was an island until it sank about 7,000 years ago due to the increasing sea level after the last ice age. With an area of 8,866 square kilometres (3,423\xa0sq\xa0mi), it is one of the largest submerged atoll structures in the world.The South China Sea is an extremely significant body of water in a geopolitical sense. It is the second most used sea lane in the world, while in terms of world annual merchant fleet tonnage, over 50% passes through the Strait of Malacca, the Sunda Strait, and the Lombok Strait. Over 1.6 million m³ (10 million barrels) of crude oil a day are shipped through the Strait of Malacca, where there are regular reports of piracy, but much less frequently than before the mid-20th century.The region has proven oil reserves of around 1.2\xa0km³ (7.7 billion barrels), with an estimate of 4.5\xa0km³ (28 billion barrels) in total. Natural gas reserves are estimated to total around 7,500\xa0km³ (266 trillion cubic feet). A 2013 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration raised the total estimated oil reserves to 11 billion barrels.[23] In 2014 China began to drill for oil in waters disputed with Vietnam.[24] The area in question is known as Vanguard Bank and which Vietnam officials claim lies within their country's 200-mile exclusive economic zone. China, however, disputes this fact.[25]According to studies made by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Philippines, this body of water holds one third of the entire world's marine biodiversity, thereby making it a very important area for the ecosystem. However the fish stocks in the area are depleted, and countries are using fishing bans as a means of asserting their sovereignty claims.[26]Indonesia's maritime waters have been breached by fishing fleets from Vietnam and the Philippines leading to said ships being seized and sunk by Indonesian authorities.[27]China announced in May 2017 a breakthrough for mining methane clathrates, when they extracted methane from hydrates in the South China Sea.[28][29]Legend： \xa0Republic of China  1：Taiping  2：Zhongzhou  \xa0People's Republic of China  3：Yongshu  4：Meiji  5：Zhubi  6：Huayang  7：Nanxun  8：Chiguo  9：Dongmen \xa0Philippines  10：Flat Island  11：Lankiam Cay  12：Loaita Cay  13：Loaita Island  14：Nanshan Island  15：Northeast Cay  16：Thitu Island   17：West York Island  18：Commodore Reef  19：Irving Reef  20：Second Thomas Reef \xa0Vietnam  21：Southwest Cay  22：Sand Cay  23：Namyit Island   24：Sin Cowe Island  25：Spratly Island  26：Amboyna Cay  27：Grierson Reef\xa0[zh]   28：Central London Reef\xa0[zh]  29：Pearson Reef\xa0[zh]  30：Barque Canada Reef\xa0[zh]  31：West London Reef\xa0[zh]  32：Ladd Reef  33：Discovery Great Reef\xa0[zh]   34：Pigeon Reef\xa0[zh]  35：East London Reef\xa0[zh]  36：Alison Reef\xa0[zh]  37：Cornwallis South Reef  38：Petley Reef\xa0[zh]  39：South Reef\xa0[zh]  40：Collins Reef  41：Lansdwone Reef\xa0[zh]  42：Bombay Castle  43：Prince of Wales Bank\xa0[zh]  44：Vanguard Bank\xa0[zh]  45：Prince Consort Bank\xa0[zh]  46：Grainger Bank\xa0[zh]  47：Alexandra Bank\xa0[zh]  48：Grainger Bank\xa0[zh]  49：Alexandra Bank\xa0[zh]  \xa0Malaysia  50：Swallow Reef  51：Ardasier Reef  52：Dallas Reef  53：Erica Reef  54：Investigator Shoal  55：Mariveles Reef Several countries have made competing territorial claims over the South China Sea. Such disputes have been regarded as Asia's most potentially dangerous point of conflict.Both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC, commonly known as Taiwan) claim almost the entire body as their own, demarcating their claims within what is known as the 'nine-dash line', which claims overlap with virtually every other country in the region. Competing claims include:China and Vietnam have both been vigorous in prosecuting their claims. China (various governments) and South Vietnam each controlled part of the Paracel Islands before 1974. A brief conflict in 1974 resulted in 18 Chinese and 53 Vietnamese deaths, and China has controlled the whole of Paracel since then. The Spratly Islands have been the site of a naval clash, in which over 70 Vietnamese sailors were killed just south of Chigua Reef in March 1988. Disputing claimants regularly report clashes between naval vessels.[citation needed]ASEAN in general, and Malaysia in particular, have been keen to ensure that the territorial disputes within the South China Sea do not escalate into armed conflict. As such, joint development authorities have been set up in areas of overlapping claims to jointly develop the area and divide the profits equally without settling the issue of sovereignty over the area. This is true particularly in the Gulf of Thailand. Generally, China has preferred to resolve competing claims bilaterally,[30] while some ASEAN countries prefer multilateral talks,[31] believing that they are disadvantaged in bilateral negotiations with the much larger China and that because many countries claim the same territory only multilateral talks could effectively resolve the competing claims.[32]The overlapping claims over Pedra Branca or Pulau Batu Putih including the neighboring Middle Rocks by both Singapore and Malaysia were settled in 2008 by the International Court of Justice, awarding Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh to Singapore and the Middle Rocks to Malaysia.In July 2010, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for China to resolve the territorial dispute. China responded by demanding the US keep out of the issue. This came at a time when both countries had been engaging in naval exercises in a show of force to the opposing side, which increased tensions in the region.[citation needed] The US Department of Defense released a statement on August 18 where it opposed the use of force to resolve the dispute, and accused China of assertive behaviour.[33] On July 22, 2011, one of India's amphibious assault vessels, the INS Airavat which was on a friendly visit to Vietnam, was reportedly contacted at a distance of 45 nautical miles (83\xa0km) from the Vietnamese coast in the disputed South China Sea on an open radio channel by a vessel identifying itself as the Chinese Navy and stating that the ship was entering Chinese waters.[34][35] The spokesperson for the Indian Navy clarified that as no ship or aircraft was visible from INS Airavat it proceeded on her onward journey as scheduled. The Indian Navy further clarified that '[t]here was no confrontation involving the INS Airavat. India supports freedom of navigation in international waters, including in the South China Sea, and the right of passage in accordance with accepted principles of international law. These principles should be respected by all.'[34]In September 2011, shortly after China and Vietnam had signed an agreement seeking to contain a dispute over the South China Sea, India's state-run explorer, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) said that its overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh Limited had signed a three-year deal with PetroVietnam for developing long-term cooperation in the oil sector[36] and that it had accepted Vietnam's offer of exploration in certain specified blocks in the South China Sea.[37] In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu issued a protest.[38][39] The spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India responded by saying that 'The Chinese had concerns but we are going by what the Vietnamese authorities have told us and have conveyed this to the Chinese.'[38] The Indo-Vietnamese deal was also denounced by the Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times.[37][39]In 1999, Taiwan claimed the entirety of the South China Sea islands under the Lee Teng-hui administration.[40] The entire subsoil, seabed and waters of the Paracels and Spratlys are claimed by Taiwan.[41]In 2012 and 2013, Vietnam and Taiwan butted heads against each other over anti-Vietnamese military exercises by Taiwan.[42]In May 2014, China established an oil rig near the Paracel Islands, leading to multiple incidents between Vietnamese and Chinese ships.[43][44]In December 2018, retired Chinese admiral Luo Yuan proposed that a possible solution to tensions with the United States in the South China Sea would be to sink one or two United States Navy aircraft carriers to break US morale.[45][46][47][48] Also in December 2018, Chinese commentator and Senior Colonel in the People's Liberation Army Air Force, Dai Xu suggested that China's navy should ram United States Navy ships sailing in the South China Sea.[45][49]The US, although not a signatory to UNCLOS, has maintained its position that its naval vessels have consistently sailed unhindered through the South China Sea and will continue to do so.[50] At times US warships have come within the 12 nautical-mile limit of Chinese-controlled islands (such as the Paracel Islands), arousing China's ire.[51] During the US Chief of Naval Operations' visit to China in early 2019, he and his Chinese counterpart worked out rules of engagement, whenever American warships and Chinese warships met up on the high seas.On 26 June 2020, the 36th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit was held virtually. Vietnam, as the Chairman of the Summit, released the Chairman's Statement. The Statement said the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is 'the basis for determining maritime entitlements, sovereign rights, jurisdiction and legitimate interests over maritime zones, and the 1982 UNCLOS sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out.'[52]It was reported by VOA on 27 August 2020 that a \u202fU.S.\u202fdefense official said that the\u202fPeople's Liberation Army of China launched four medium-range ballistic missiles from mainland China into an area of the South China Sea.[53]In January 2013, the Philippines formally initiated arbitration proceedings against China's claim on the territories within the 'Nine-Dash Line' that includes the Spratly Islands, which it said is unlawful under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).[54][55]On July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration backed the Philippines, saying that there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources, hence there was 'no legal basis for China to claim historic rights' over the nine-dash line.[56][57] The tribunal also criticized China's land reclamation projects and its construction of artificial islands in the Spratly Islands, saying that it had caused 'severe harm to the coral reef environment'.[58] A letter from the Chinese ambassador asserted that some foreign media, the Philippines and the arbitral tribunal areattempting to characterize Taiping island as a 'rock' under UNCLOS, and therefore are not entitled to a 200-nautical-mile (370\xa0km) exclusive economic zone.[59] China rejected the ruling, calling it 'ill-founded'.[60] Taiwan (ROC), which administers Taiping Island, the largest of the Spratly Islands, also rejected the ruling.[61][62]In March 2020, the Philippines expressed its concern about approximately 220 Chinese military vessels that were spotted in the disputed area.[63]", 'attributes': {'name': 'South China Sea', 'img': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Mar_de_China_Meridional_-_BM_WMS_2004.jpg/264px-Mar_de_China_Meridional_-_BM_WMS_2004.jpg', 'img_des': 'Satellite image of the South China SeaThe northeastern portion of the South China Sea', 'Coordinates': '.mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output .geo-dec{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault,.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct{display:none}.mw-parser-output .longitude,.mw-parser-output .latitude{white-space:nowrap}12°N 113°E\ufeff / \ufeff12°N 113°E\ufeff / 12; 113Coordinates: 12°N 113°E\ufeff / \ufeff12°N 113°E\ufeff / 12; 113', 'Type': 'Sea', 'Part of': 'Pacific Ocean', 'River sources': 'AgnoJiulongMekongMinPahangPampangaPasigPearlRajangRed', 'Basin countries': 'List BruneiChinaIndonesiaMalaysiaPhilippinesTaiwanVietnam', 'Surface area': '3,500,000 square kilometres (1,400,000 sq mi)', 'Islands': 'List of islands in the South China Sea', 'Trenches': 'Manila Trench', 'Settlements': 'Major cities AlaminosBà RịaBạc LiêuBacoorBalangaBintuluCẩm PhảCam RanhCandonCavite CityDa NangDagupanĐồng HớiHạ LongHà TĩnhHaikouHaiphongHo Chi MinhHội AnHong KongKaohsiungKota KinabaluKuala TerengganuKuantanKuchingLaoagLas PiñasMacauMalolosManilaMersingMiriMóng CáiNakhon Si ThammaratNam ĐịnhNanwanNavotasNha TrangOlongapoParañaquePasayPattayaPekanPhan Rang–Tháp ChàmPhan ThiếtQuảng NgãiQui NhơnSầm SơnSan FernandoSanyaShantouSihanoukvilleSóc TrăngSurat ThaniTaitungTainanTam KỳThái BìnhThanh HóaViganTuy HòaVũng TàuXiamenZhanjiang'}}

{'keyword': '航空母舰', 'source': 'wiki', 'title': 'Chinese aircraft carrier programme', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_aircraft_carrier_programme', 'date': 202110171942, 'content': "Since the 1970s, China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has had ambitions to develop and operate aircraft carriers, and since 1985 has acquired four retired aircraft carriers for study; namely, the British-built Australian HMAS\xa0Melbourne and the ex-Soviet carriers Minsk, Kiev and Varyag. The Varyag later underwent an extensive refit to be converted into the Liaoning, China's first operational aircraft carrier, which also served as a basis for China's subsequent design iterations. As of 2018[update], the PLAN has two combat-ready aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, with the third under construction.[1] It is projected that China may possess five or six aircraft carriers by the 2030s.[2]Since the 1970s, the PLAN has expressed interest in operating an aircraft carrier as part of its blue water aspirations.[3] The first official plan of PLAN aircraft carrier development dated back on 31 March 1987 when the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense approved the plan on the aircraft carrier and the next generation nuclear submarine for PLAN advocated and submitted by the then commander-in-chief of PLAN, Liu Huaqing. The original plan was to be progressed in stages, with basic research to be completed by the end of the 7th 5-year plan, and development of the platform and aircraft to be completed by the end of the 8th 5-year plan. By 2000, construction was to begin when ordered.[citation needed]To prepare the commanders needed for the future aircraft carriers, the Central Military Commission approved the program of training jet fighter pilots to be future captains in May 1987, and the Guangzhou Naval Academy was selected as the site.[4]However, Liu Huaqing's plan proved to be too ambitious as the domestic Chinese industry at the time could not meet the goal demanded by the plan. As a result, the plan was drastically scaled back to basic research level and the date for an aircraft carrier entering PLAN service was postponed and eventually put on hold. In the meantime, pilot candidates for warship captain training was also altered, with candidates switched to ship-borne helicopter pilots, because it was considered that naval helicopter pilots with much more ship-borne aviation experience would be better prepared than the land-based jet fighter pilots who lack ship-borne aviation experience.[citation needed]China acquired the Royal Australian Navy's decommissioned aircraft carrier HMAS\xa0Melbourne in February 1985, when it was sold to the China United Shipbuilding Company to be towed to China and broken up for scrap.[5] Prior to the ship's departure for China, the RAN stripped Melbourne of all electronic equipment and weapons, and welded her rudders into a fixed position so that she could not be reactivated. However, her steam catapult, arresting equipment and mirror landing system were not removed. At this time, few western experts expected that the Chinese Government would attempt to develop aircraft carriers in the future.[6] Melbourne finally arrived in China on 13 June.[7]The ship was not scrapped immediately; instead she was studied by Chinese naval architects and engineers.[8] It is unclear whether the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) orchestrated the acquisition of Melbourne or simply took advantage of the situation; Rear Admiral Zhang Zhaozhong, a staff member at the National Defence College, has stated that the Navy was unaware of the purchase until Melbourne first arrived at Guangzhou.[6] Melbourne was the largest warship any of the Chinese experts had seen, and they were surprised by the amount of equipment which was still in place. The PLAN subsequently arranged for the ship's flight deck and all the equipment associated with flying operations to be removed so that they could be studied in depth.[6] Reports have circulated that either a replica of the flight deck, or the deck itself, was used for clandestine training of People's Liberation Army Navy pilots in carrier flight operations.[8]Chinese engineers reverse-engineered a land-based replica of the steam catapult and landing system from that of HMAS\xa0Melbourne, and a J-8IIG was used to conduct take-off and landing trials on the land-based flight deck in April 1987, which was not finally confirmed officially until 27 years later in April 2014 by CCTV-13.[9][unreliable source?] Both the take-off and landing were conducted on the same day, and the test pilot was PLANAF pilot Li Guoqiang.[10][unreliable source?] The experience gained would be later applied to the development of the Shenyang J-15.[11][irrelevant citation]It has also been claimed that the Royal Australian Navy received and 'politely rejected' a request from the PLAN for blueprints of the ship's steam catapult.[6] The carrier was not dismantled for many years; according to some rumours she was not completely broken up until 2002.[5]China also negotiated with Spain in an effort purchase the blueprints for proposed conventional take off/landing ships from Empresa Nacional Bazán, specifically 23,000-ton SAC-200 and 25,000-ton SAC-220 designs. Negotiations started between 1995 and 1996 but did not result in any purchase. However, the Spanish firm was paid several million US dollars in consulting fees, indicating the probable transfer of some design concepts.[4]China acquired the former Soviet  Kiev-class aircraft carriers Minsk in 1995 and Kiev in 2000. Minsk, along with its sister ship Novorossiysk, were initially sold to South Korea in 1995 to be scrapped,[8] but due to objections from environmentalists,[12] Minsk was resold to China in 1998 to be broken up there instead.[8][12] Kiev, likewise, was sold to China in 2000 by Russia with a contractual requirement for it to be scrapped.[8] However, neither ship was dismantled and both were instead converted into tourist attractions, with Minsk turned into a theme park[13][14] and Kiev a luxury hotel.[15]In 1997, China attempted to purchase the retired French aircraft carrier Clemenceau, but negotiations between China and France failed.[4]The 67,500\xa0ton ex-Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag ( Kuznetsov class), which was only 68% completed and floating in Ukraine, was purchased through a private Macau tourist venture in 1998. Following her troublesome tow to Dalian shipyard, the carrier underwent a long refit. Varyag had been stripped of any military equipment as well as her propulsion systems prior to being put up for sale. In 2007 there were news reports that she was being fitted-out to enter service.[16][17]In 2011, People's Liberation Army Chief of the General Staff Chen Bingde confirmed that China was constructing at least one aircraft carrier.[18] On 10 August 2011, it was announced that the refurbishment of Varyag was complete, and that it was undergoing sea trials.[19][20]On 14 December 2011, DigitalGlobe, an American Satellite imaging company, announced that while scouring through pictures taken 8 December, it had discovered the retrofitted Varyag undergoing trials, DigitalGlobe further stated that their images captured the ship in the Yellow Sea where it operated for 5 days.[21]In September 2012, it was announced that this carrier would be named Liaoning, after Liaoning Province of China. In September 2012, China's first aircraft carrier, Liaoning, was commissioned.[22] On 23 September 2012, Liaoning was handed over to the People's Liberation Army Navy, but was not yet in active service.[23]In November 2012, the first landing was successfully conducted on Liaoning with Shenyang J-15.[24]Four years later, in November 2016, it was reported that Liaoning was combat ready. China has confirmed that it is constructing a second carrier that will be built entirely with indigenous Chinese designs. Similar to Liaoning, China's second carrier will also use a ski jump for takeoff.[22]In mid-2007, Chinese domestic sources revealed that China had purchased a total of four sets of aircraft carrier landing systems from Russia[25] and this was confirmed by Russian manufacturers. However, experts disagreed on the usage of these systems: while some have claimed that it is a clear evidence of the construction of an aircraft carrier, others claim these systems are used to train pilots for a future ship. In August 2008, Huang Qiang, the speaker of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense announced to the public at a news conference that China had mastered all of the technologies for an aircraft carrier, and would build aircraft carriers in the future when the time was deemed right.[citation needed] Reports initially claimed that up to two carriers based on the Varyag would be started by 2015.[16]According to the Nippon News Network (NNN), research and development on the planned carriers is being carried out at a military research facility in Wuhan.  NNN states that the actual carriers will be constructed at Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai.[26]  Kanwa Intelligence Review reports that the second carrier to be constructed will likely be assigned to Qingdao.[27]According to a February 2011 report in The Daily Telegraph, the Chinese military has constructed a concrete aircraft carrier flight deck to use for training carrier pilots and carrier operations personnel.  The deck was constructed on top of a government building near Wuhan (Wuhan Technical College of Communication campus next to Huangjiahu).[28] On 7 June 2011, People's Liberation Army Chief of the General Staff Chen Bingde confirmed that China was constructing its own aircraft carrier. He stated he would provide no further details until it was complete.[18]On 30 July 2011, a senior researcher of the Academy of Military Sciences said China needed at least three aircraft carriers. 'If we consider our neighbours, India will have three aircraft carriers by 2014 and Japan will have three carriers by 2014, so I think the number (for China) should not be less than three so we can defend our rights and our maritime interests effectively.' General Luo Yuan.[29] In July 2011, a Chinese official announced that two aircraft carriers were being built at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai.[30][31] On 21 May 2012, Taiwan's intelligence chief Tsai Teh-sheng told the Legislative Yuan that the PLA Navy plans to build two carriers, scheduled to start construction in 2013 and 2015 and launch in 2020 and 2022 respectively.[32] The price of the two vessels is estimated to be worth US$9 Billion dollars.[33]On 24 April 2013, Chinese Rear Admiral Song Xue confirmed that China will build more carriers and these will be larger and will carry more fighter-planes than Liaoning.[34]The Type 002 is China's first domestically produced aircraft carrier. Construction began in November 2013 and the ship was launched on 26 April 2017. After being fitted out, China's first homemade aircraft carrier underwent nine sea trials over the course of 18 months, starting from May 2018. The ship was formally commissioned into service on 19 December 2019 as the Shandong, with pennant number '17'.[35]The 002 is a conventionally powered ski jump carrier with a displacement of around 70,000 tonnes. The ship is derived from the Liaoning. It uses conventional steam turbines with diesel generators as propulsion.  The Shandong is a significant improvement over the Soviet-built Liaoning. For example, the Shandong carrier's ski-jump has an angle of 12.0°, an angle ideal for launching the Shenyang J-15 fighter, instead of the 14.0° on the Liaoning.  Together with the enlarged hangar, the island (which has been made smaller by 10%), and extended on sponsons in the aft-starboard quarter, space has been freed up allowing for up to eight more aircraft and helicopters to be carried.  The island includes a second glazed deck which permits the bridge and flight control areas to be separate, creating greater operational efficiency.  It also features a faceted upper area of four active electronically scanned arrays (AESAs) for the S-band Type 346 radar.[36]The third aircraft carrier, known as Type 003, is an entirely different design than Liaoning and Shandong. It is the largest of China's current fleet. The Type 003 will have a displacement of around 85,000 tonnes and be approximately the size of the US Navy's Ford Class ships.[37]In 2015, media reports stated that both an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and a steam-powered catapult were constructed at the Huangdicun naval base for testing; this is thought to indicate that the Type 003 class as well as future PLAN carriers could possibly be CATOBAR carriers.[38]The construction of the first Type 003 class aircraft carrier started in February 2017.[39] Satellite observation at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai only shows one carrier of this type under construction.[37]It was reported in early 2021 that the first ship would be launched in the same year, with construction already started on a second ship in this class.[40]The Type 004 is planned to be larger than the Type 003, and also feature nuclear propulsion,[41] which could power weapons like lasers and railguns.[42] It is claimed that construction started in December 2017[43] at Jiangnan Shipyard.[44]China initially intended to acquire Russian Sukhoi Su-33 carrier-based aircraft to be operated from its aircraft carriers.[45]  However, China later developed the Shenyang J-15 as a derivative of the Su-33,[46] featuring Chinese technology and avionics from the J-11B program.[46]  On 25 November 2012, it was announced that at least two Shenyang J-15s had successfully landed on Liaoning.[24][47]  The pilot credited with having achieved the first landing was Dai Mingmeng.[48] According to Chinese media reports, the J-15 cannot take off from Liaoning with a full fuel and munition load, being unable to get off the carrier's ski jump-ramp if the payload exceeds 12 tonnes (26,000\xa0lb).[49]The Shenyang FC-31 is an in-development medium-sized fifth-generation stealth fighter that may in future be adopted for carrier use.[50]  The South China Morning Post reported on 6 July 2018 that China is developing an upgraded variant of the FC-31 as an alternate carrier operational jet.[51]", 'attributes': None}

A mother ship may be a maritime ship, aircraft, or spacecraft. Examples include bombers converted to carry experimental aircraft to altitudes where they can conduct their research (such as the B-52 carrying the X-15), or ships that carry small submarines to an area of ocean to be explored (such as the Atlantis II carrying the Alvin).A mother ship may also be used to recover smaller craft, or go its own way after releasing them.A smaller vessel serving or caring for larger craft is usually called a tender.In many Asian languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Indonesian, the word mothership (Chinese: 母舰, Japanese: 母艦, Korean: 모함, Indonesian: Kapal induk, literally 'mother' + '(war)ship') typically refers to an aircraft carrier, which is translated as 'aircraft/aviation mothership' (Chinese: 航空母舰, Japanese: 航空母艦, Korean: 항공모함, Malay: Kapal induk pesawat udara).During World War II, the German Type XIV submarine or Milchkuh (Milk cow) was a type of large submarine used to resupply the U-boats.Mother ships can carry small submersibles and submarines to an area of ocean to be explored (such as the Atlantis II carrying the Alvin).Somalian pirates use mother ships to extend the reach of their attacking speed boats into the Indian Ocean.In aviation, motherships have been used in the airborne aircraft carrier, air launch and captive carry roles. Some large long-range aircraft act as motherships to parasite aircraft. A mothership may also form the larger component of a composite aircraft.During the age of the great airships, the United States built two rigid airships, USS\xa0Akron\xa0(ZRS-4) and USS\xa0Macon\xa0(ZRS-5), with onboard hangars able to house a number of Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters. These airborne aircraft carriers operated successfully for several years.[1] These airships utilized an internal hangar bay using a 'trapeze' to hold the aircraft.[2]In the air launch role, a large carrier aircraft or mother ship carries a smaller payload aircraft to a launch point and then releases it.During World War II the Japanese Mitsubishi G4M bomber was used to carry the rocket-powered Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka aircraft, used for kamikaze attacks, within range of a target ship. Germany also planned a jet-carrying bomber, called the Daimler-Benz Project C.In the US, NASA has used converted bombers as launch platforms for experimental aircraft. Notable among these was the use during the 1960s of a modified Boeing B-52 Stratofortress for the repeated launching of the North American X-15.In a captive carry arrangement the payload craft, such as a rocket, missile, aeroplane or spaceplane, does not separate from the carrier aircraft.Captive carry is typically used to conduct initial testing on a new airframe or system, before it is ready for free flight[3][4][5]Captive carry is sometimes also used to transport an aircraft or spacecraft on a ferry flight. Notable examples include:Some large long-range aircraft have been modified as motherships in order to carry parasite aircraft which support the mothership by extending its role, for example for reconnaissance, or acting in a support role such as fighter defence.[7][8]The first experiments with rigid airships to launch and recover fighters were carried out during World War I.The British experimented with the 23-class airships from that time. Then in the 1920s, as part of the 'Airship Development Programme', they used the R33 for experiments. A de Havilland Humming Bird light aeroplane with a hook fitted was slung beneath it.[9] In October 1925 Squadron Leader Rollo Haig, was released from the R33, and then reattached.[10] Later that year, the attempt was repeated and the Humming Bird remained attached until the airship landed.In 1926, it carried two Gloster Grebe fighters releasing them at the Pulham and Cardington airship stations.[11]In America, USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), used for prototype testing for the Akron and Macon airborne aircraft carriers.During World War II the Soviet Tupolev-Vakhmistrov Zveno project developed converted Tupolev TB-1 and TB-3 aircraft to carry and launch up to five smaller craft, typically in roles such as fighter escort or fighter-bomber.During the early days of the jet age, fighter aircraft could not fly long distances and still match point-defence fighters or interceptors in dogfighting. The solution was long-range bombers that would carry or tow their escort fighters.The later American FICON-equipped modified B-36 Peacemaker bombers.[7] The B-29 Superfortress and B-36 bombers were tested as carriers for the RF-84K Thunderflash (FICON project) and XF-85 Goblin fighters.In November 2014, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) requested industry proposals for a system in which small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would be launched and recovered by their existing conventional large aircraft, including the B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers and C-130 Hercules and C-17 Globemaster III transports.[12]In a composite aircraft, two or more component aircraft take off as a single unit and later separate. The British Short S.21 Maia experimental flying boat served as the mother ship component of the Short Mayo Composite two-plane maritime trans-Atlantic project design in the 1930s.[7][13]The mother ship concept was used in Moon landings performed in the 1960s. Both the 1962 American Ranger and the 1966 Soviet Luna unmanned landers were spherical capsules designed to be ejected at the last moment from mother ships that carried them to the Moon, and crashed onto its surface. In the manned Apollo program, astronauts in the Lunar Module left the Command/Service Module mother ship in lunar orbit, descended to the surface, and returned to dock in a lunar orbit rendezvous with the mother ship once more for the return to Earth.[14]The Scaled Composites White Knight series of aircraft are designed to launch spacecraft which they carry underneath them.There have been numerous sightings of UFOs claimed to be mother ships, many in the U.S. during the summer of 1947. A woman in Palmdale, California, was quoted by contemporary press as describing a 'mother saucer (with a) bunch of little saucers playing around it'.[15] The term mothership was also popularized in UFO lore by contactee George Adamski, who claimed in the 1950s to sometimes see large cigar-shaped Venusian motherships, out of which flew smaller-sized flying saucer scout ships. Adamski claimed to have met and befriended the pilots of these scout ships, including a Venusian named Orthon.[16]The concept of a mother ship also occurs in science fiction, extending the idea to spaceships that serve as the equivalent of flagships among a fleet. In this context, mother ship is often spelled as one word: mothership. A mothership may be large enough that its body contains a station for the rest of the fleet.[17]", 'attributes': None}

{'keyword': '航空母舰', 'source': 'wiki', 'title': 'Mandarin Chinese profanity', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese_profanity', 'date': 202110090416, 'content': "Profanity in Mandarin Chinese most commonly involves sexual references and scorn of the object's ancestors, especially their mother. Other Mandarin insults accuse people of not being human. Compared to English, scatological and blasphemous references are less often used. In this article, unless otherwise noted, the traditional character will follow its simplified form if it is different.As in English, many Mandarin Chinese slang terms involve the genitalia or other sexual terms. Slang words for the penis refer to it literally, and are not necessarily negative words:Note: One should note that in Middle Chinese the words for 屌 and 鳥 were homophones. The fǎnqiè of '屌' (丁了切) and the fǎnqiè of 'simplified Chinese: 鸟; traditional Chinese: 鳥' (都了切) denoted the same pronunciation; both began with a voiceless unaspirated alveolar stop (/t/ in IPA and d in pinyin) and the same vowel and tone.  Based on regular sound change rules, we would expect the word for bird in Mandarin to be pronounced diǎo, but Mandarin dialects' pronunciations of the word for bird evolved to an alveolar nasal initial, likely as a means of taboo avoidance, giving contemporary niǎo while most dialects in the south retain the Middle Chinese alveolar stop initial and the homophony or near homophony of these words.There appear to be more words for vagina than for penis. The former are more commonly used as insults and are also more aggressive and have negative connotations:In addition to the above expressions used as insults directed against women, other insults involve insinuating that they are prostitutes:Male masturbation, at least, has several vulgar expressions, in addition to two formal/scientific ones that refer to both male and female masturbation (shǒuyín 手淫 and zìwèi 自慰):As in English, a vulgar word for the sexual act is used in insults and expletives:Insulting someone's mother is also common:The 中文大辭典 Zhōng wén dà cí diǎn (Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Chinese Language)), discusses 王八 (wáng bā) in vol. 6 p.\xa0281. 'Wáng bā' is the term that is usually written casually for the slur that means something like 'son of a bitch.'A 'wángbādàn 忘/王八蛋' is the offspring of a woman lacking virtue. Another meaning of 王八 is 鼈 biē, fresh-water turtle.[5] Turtle heads reemerging from hiding in the turtle's shell look like the glans emerging from the foreskin, and turtles lay eggs. So a 'wang ba' is a woman who has lost her virtue, and a 'wang ba dan' is the progeny of such a woman, a turtle product, but, figuratively, also a penis product. 龜頭 (guītóu, 'turtle head') can refer to the glans of the penis.'Wáng bā 王八' originally got switched over from another '忘八 wàng bā' (one that referred to any very unvirtuous individual) because of a man with the family name Wáng 王 who picked up the nickname 賊王八 zéi Wáng bā ('the thieving Wang Eight') but for being a dastard, not for being a bastard. The dictionary doesn't say, but he may have been the eighth Wang among his siblings. Anyway, he became 'crook Wang eight' and the term stuck and spread just as 'Maverick' did in English. There is a pun here because of the earlier expression 忘八 wáng bā used to describe (1) any person who forgets/disregards the eight virtues, (2) an un-virtuous woman, i.e., one who sleeps around. The first meaning applied to the dastardly Wang, but the family name got 'stuck' to the second, sexual, term.[citation needed]Many insults imply that the interlocutor's mother or even grandmother was promiscuous. The turtle is emblematic of the penis and also of promiscuous intercourse, because turtles were once thought to conceive by thought alone, making paternity impossible to prove. Eggs are the progeny of turtles and other lower animals, so the word dàn (蛋) is a metonym for offspring.References to various kinds of disability are sometimes used against both abled and disabled people as an insult. While there are vulgar expressions in English referring to the buttocks or rectum, there are no real equivalents in Mandarin. Pìgu yǎn (屁股眼) or pìyǎnr (屁眼兒/屁眼儿), one expression for anus, is not vulgar, but it occurs in various curses involving an imperforate anusAs in the West, highly sexual women have been stigmatized. Terms for males who sleep around are rare.Occasionally, slang words with a negative connotation are turned around and used positively:Other insults include the word hùn (混), which means 'mixed-up', or hùn (simplified Chinese: 浑; traditional Chinese: 渾), which means 'muddy':Perhaps due to the influence of wángbādàn (王八蛋), dàn (蛋; 'egg') is used in a number of other insults in addition to hùndàn (混蛋):The word guā (瓜; melon or gourd) is also used in insults:In addition to the senses listed above, the 'melon' is a metonym for the womb, and a 'broken melon' refers to a female's lost virginity.The noun 棍 gùn, stick/staff is often used to refer to someone who is morally corrupted.The noun for 'ghost' 鬼 is often used to mock someone with some bad habit. The mocking tone may not be very serious though.精 'nonhuman spirit in a human's form' is usually for insulting some cunning people.Because shame or 'face' is important in Chinese culture, insulting someone as 'shameless' is much stronger than in English:Other insults accuse people of lacking qualities expected of a human being:Sǐ (死; 'dead', 'cadaverous,' or, less precisely, 'damn(ed)') is used in a number of insults:The words '屎' (shǐ) (= turd, dung), '粪' (fèn) (= manure, excrement) and '大便 (= stool, poop)' (dà biàn), all mean feces but vary from blunt four letter to family-friendly, respectively. They can all be used in compound words and sentences in a profane manner.Originally, the various Mandarin Chinese words for 'excrement' were less commonly used as expletives, but that is changing. Perhaps because farting results in something that is useless even for fertilizer: 'fàng pì' (放屁; lit. 'to fart') is an expletive in Mandarin. The word 'pì' (屁; lit. 'fart') or the phrase is commonly used as an expletive in Mandarin (i.e. 'bullshit!').In a 1968 academic study of Chinese pejorative words, more than a third of the 325-term corpus of abusive expressions compare the insulted person with an animal, with the worst curses being 'animal' generally, 'pig, dog, animal', or 'animal in dress', which deny the person of human dignity.[10] The expressions contain metaphorical references to the following domesticated animals: dogs, cows, and chickens (12 or 11 terms each), (8 times), horse (4), cat (3), and duck (2), and one each to sheep, donkey and camel.[11]  A variety of wild animals are used in these pejorative terms, and the most common are monkey (7 times) and tiger (5 times), symbolizing ugliness and power respectively.[12]The fact that many insults are prefaced with the Mandarin Chinese word for dog attest to the animal's low status:In at least one case, rabbit is part of an insult:The Chinese word for bird 'niǎo'(鸟) was pronounced as 'diǎo' in ancient times, which rhymes with (屌) meaning penis or sexual organ.[13] It also sounds the same as 'penis' in several Chinese dialects. Thus, bird is often associated with 'fuck', 'penis' or 'nonsense'：A tigress or 母老虎 (Mǔ lǎohǔ) refers to a fierce woman, usually someone's strict wife.A dinosaur or 恐龙 (Kǒnglóng) has been used as Internet slang to describe an ugly girl.Certain words are used for expressing contempt or strong disapproval:Some expressions are harder to explain:Some expressions represent offensive insults involving some kind of actions:Many locations within China have their own local slang, which is scarcely used elsewhere.Mandarin Chinese has specific terms and racial euphemisms for different races and ethnicities, and some discriminatory slurs against representatives from certain governments and backgrounds.There are various circumlocutions in Mandarin Chinese for homosexual, and the formal terms are recent additions just as is the direct translation of 'masturbation' (hand soiling).Duànxiù (simplified Chinese: 断 袖; traditional Chinese: 斷袖) — cut off sleeve, from the story of a ruler whose male favorite fell asleep on the sleeve of his jacket, so when the ruler had to get up to conduct some needed business he cut his sleeve off rather than awaken his lover (See Bret Hinsch, Passions of the Cut Sleeve, p.\xa053). An analogous story, of a sleeve being cut off so as not to disturb a sleeping cat, is told of both Confucius and Muhammad, and perhaps others.Yútáo (simplified Chinese: 余 桃; traditional Chinese: 餘桃) — remains of a peach, from the story of a favorite who rather too familiarly offered his sovereign a peach of which he had already eaten half. (From Han Fei Zi, chapter 12)Bōlí (玻璃), literally 'glass', but implies 'glass person'. It comes from a passage in the Dream of the Red Chamber in which Phoenix is described as having a 'crystal heart in a glass body,' meaning that she was glistening, pure, clear, fastidious, etc. It stands as high praise for a lady, but comes off as an effeminate slur when referring to men. The English translation of Bai Xian-yong's novel about male homosexuals in Taiwan includes the term 'crystal boys,' derived from the same passage in the earlier novel, and also a rather gruff reference to the old photographer who befriends some of the boys as 'you old glass,' which, delivered by a female friend of his, comes out sounding about on the level of 'you old fart,' i.e., not really so very offensive, but indicating a passing mood of aggravation on the speaker's part. Nevertheless, the general meaning is probably closer to 'old queer.'Nán fēng (simplified Chinese: 男风; traditional Chinese: 男風), male custom, is homophonous with (南風, southern custom.) The first writing of the term would fairly easily be picked out as referring to sexual interactions, whereas the second term could just mean 'the customs of the southern part of China.'Tóngzhì (同志; lit.\u2009'comrade') was recently adopted in Hong Kong and Taiwan to mean homosexual, and is sometimes used on the mainland. Literally the term means 'one having same aspirations'.Tùzi (兔子), used to refer to catamites. (See Herbert A. Giles, A Chinese-English Dictionary, entry 12,122) See also Tu Er Shen.Since the success of Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain, duànbèi (simplified Chinese: 断背; traditional Chinese: 斷背, lit. 'Brokeback') has also become popular.", 'attributes': None}

                '使用兵种': '步兵',
                '分类': '主要分为杀伤型和反装甲型',
                '特点': '提高了步兵作战能力'},
 'content': '枪榴弹是步兵近距离上使用的点面杀伤武器，主要用于杀伤有生目标，摧毁各种轻型装甲目标、永久火力点等野战工事。因此，枪榴弹的装备使用大大提高了步兵在现代战场上对付点、面目标和反装甲的作战能力。[1]\xa0'
            '枪榴弹的种类较多。按用途，分为杀伤枪榴弹、破甲枪榴弹、多用途枪榴弹、燃烧枪榴弹、照明枪榴弹、发烟枪榴弹、化学枪榴弹、演习训练枪榴弹等；按发射装置，分为尾管式枪榴弹、尾杆式枪榴弹、全入式枪榴弹、环翼式枪榴弹和弹筒合一式枪榴弹等。[2]\xa0'
            '由战斗部、引信和弹尾部件组成。战斗部的结构与手榴弹相似，形状为圆柱形，内装炸药、化学药剂和其他元件，如破甲枪榴弹的药型罩等。引信有延期时间引信、触发引信、近炸引信和其他引信，使战斗部能在最有利时机作用。弹尾部件有尾管和尾杆两种。发射时尾管套在枪榴弹发射具上，承载发射推力并赋予枪榴弹一定的射向，尾管外有翼片，其作用是保持枪榴弹的飞行稳定。尾杆是早期枪榴弹采用的部件，大多为木杆，杆上刻有射程标记，发射时将尾杆插入筒形发射具，以插入的深度来调整枪榴弹的射程。[2]\xa0'
            '枪榴弹发射具装在枪口使用，多数现代步枪的枪管口部可兼作枪榴弹发射具。用于发射枪榴弹的枪弹有普通枪弹与空包弹，用普通枪弹发射的枪榴弹必须有弹头吸收器、过弹器或弹头偏离装置。常用的是安装在枪榴弹底部尾管内的弹头吸收器。发射时，弹头吸收器将射来的弹头阻止在弹底部，并将弹头的能量和火药燃气压力转换成枪榴弹动能，使枪榴弹获得一定的初速。有的弹头吸收器还装有辅助装药，可使枪榴弹的飞行速度进一步提高。有过弹器的枪榴弹在战斗部的中心有一条允许弹头经过的通道，有弹头偏离装置的枪榴弹在弹底装有一个使弹头从侧面飞离的装置和气体偏流器。这两种枪榴弹都没有弹头吸收器，但都可以用普通枪弹发射。空包弹是一种不装弹头的枪弹，发射时靠火药燃气推动枪榴弹运动。用空包弹发射的枪榴弹一般重量较大、射程较近。但具有结构比较简单和安全性较高等优点。杀伤枪榴弹的直径一般为35～65毫米，弹全重200～600克，射程300～700米，杀伤半径10～30米。破甲枪榴弹的直径为40～75毫米，弹重300～1000克，直射距离50～100米，垂直穿透装甲钢板的厚度为100～300毫米，穿透混凝土的厚度为300～1000毫米。其他枪榴弹的尺寸根据其战术使命确定。[2]\xa0'
            '枪榴弹出现较早，19世纪中叶出现了杀伤枪榴弹。第二次世界大战前夕，英国、美国、日本和德国等国家研制成采用尾翼稳定或旋转稳定，直接插入枪口或用杯形发射器发射的杀伤枪榴弹和破甲枪榴弹。20世纪50年代以后，许多国家将制式步枪的枪管口部设计成枪榴弹发射具，发明了弹头吸收器、过弹器和弹头偏离装置等，可用普通枪弹发射枪榴弹。随后，火箭增程枪榴弹、伸缩式枪榴弹、跳炸枪榴弹、多用途枪榴弹等相继问世。法国、比利时和以色列等国还研制成功由杀伤、破甲、燃烧等枪榴弹组成的枪榴弹系列。枪榴弹的发展趋势是：应用新技术，实现弹重轻量化、弹种系列化、功能多元化；探索和采用新工艺、新结构和改进发射方式，如采用增程火箭，增大有效射程等。随着科学技术的发展，新一代枪榴弹的综合性能将大幅度提高。[2]\xa0'
            '当前枪榴弹的主要发展趋势是：1.弹质量减小，弹种系列化枪榴弹减小弹质量、增大威力是枪榴弹改进设计的目的。关键在于战斗部结构的改进和新材料的应用，通过合理调配弹质量、威力与后坐力三者之间的关系，使枪榴弹达到最佳作战效果。另外，为了满足步兵在未来战场上对付各种目标的需要，枪榴弹正在向着弹种系列化的方向发展。弹种系列化不仅为步兵完成各种不同战斗任务创造了条件，而且给生产、使用、贮存、后勤供应带来极大方便。2.采用实弹发射，简化操作程序枪榴弹采用空包弹发射不仅操作程序复杂，容易贻误战机，而且一旦误装实弹必将造成严重后果。因此，通过捕弹器采用实弹发射是枪榴弹发展的必由之路。捕弹器除了朝通用化、绝对安全型方向发展外，还发展了弹丸偏转器与其相结合的结构。3.改进发射方式，增大有效射程枪榴弹采用实弹发射固然有许多优点，但由于各种枪榴弹的发射装药是一定的，当枪榴弹弹形和弹质量确定后，其射程即为定值。因此，如何改进枪榴弹发射方式，提高枪榴弹的有效射程和射击精度是枪榴弹发展的又一重大课题。利用火箭增程虽可提高枪榴弹射程（可达800m），但仍需解决后坐力大、弹质量大和精度差的问题。4.应用新技术，探索新结构枪榴弹由于受到体积和质量的限制，故新材料、新原理、新结构、新技术在枪榴弹上的应用显得格外重要。当前尽管高强度、高韧性的非金属材料已在枪榴弹上普遍采用，压电引信、电磁引信与其他电子引信正在逐步配置，钢丝缠绕预制破片弹体、高能炸药、新的破甲战斗部结构等已在枪榴弹上应用，但一些传统的概念和结构仍未打破。为全面改善枪榴弹结构，大幅度提高其性能，还有许多技术问题，特别是在发射原理和战斗效能上，需要进一步探索和解决。展望未来，作为步兵简易武器的枪榴弹，在技术上将有新的发展。[1]\xa0',
